3,3.0,"I was coming of age during the second intifada and learned about Israel and Palestine and became pro-Palestinian. Over the past several years I've been becoming more pro-Israel as I journied from conservative to liberal to socialist. Also prior to this I came out, so this has been a journey for sure.

It's incredibly naive to be LGBT and to support an ideology that would murder you the moment they had a chance. I believe the Star Wars effect play into this as well where there is this understanding that if you are a smaller resistance fighting against an empire then you are automatically the underdog and right by default.

I want peace. I want a two state solution. I want a free and secure Palestine alongside Israel. But if one side only sees peace as possible so long as the otherside is cleansed from the land... Ultimately what has happened over the past couple days is going to turn many middle of the road types more into the pro-Israel camp.",2023-10-08 07:44:32

6,6.0,"I changed my mind. I thought the IDF actually harmed Palestinians and I thought their last behavior was a human rights issue. But after seeing these animalistic Palestinian Muslim Jihadists Terrorist Hamas low lives murder, rape, and torture children, young girls, the elderly, they need to be wiped out. Any Jihadist extremism needs to be eliminated. And Israel needs to enforce stricter policies or a more effective occupation. This is absolutely one of the worst crimes against humanity cases in a developed country, aside from Ukraine. 
We see this conflict in Turkey/Kurds, Russia/Ukraine, USA/Native Americans, China/Taiwan-Uighur, Burma/Rohingya, Hutus/Tutsi. This is nothing new. An apartheid, a one or two state solution that is undeniably impossibly to uphold and implement. These acts of terror and crime are predominantly done by Jihadist Muslims, with the exception of Russia/Ukraine. No side is truly innocent. All sides have reacted in context of self defense. However, this needs to stop. Enough is enough. When will there be enough rape, murder, and corruption? If you support Hamas, you are a terrorist. You are Anti-Semitic. If you support Free Palestine through the persecution and murder of Jews, you are also a terrorist. Crimes against humanity should not take a side or be affiliated politically with one group of people who feel oppressed and need solidarity. Crimes against humanity are simply, crimes against humanity. No matter if you’re Palestinian MuslIm, Israeli Jew, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Burmese, Rohingya, etc. This is not right. We need to stop fighting against each other and leveling ourselves supports of Israel of Palestine. But right now, I support justice. And if Israel needs to defend her land from this terror attack and reclaim their citizens who are being held hostage, I support that because that is an act of justice. Also, the fact that the President of Palestine isn’t reprimanding those horrors tells me all I need to know. He condones evil and violence. Lastly, for those of who don’t know, there is a video on combat footage showing a Palestinian Jihadist father using his infant child as a shield as he yells at him and tells him to walk towards the Israeli soldiers and raise his Palestinian flag. This is evil. It is selfish. That is not justice. I hope you consider the weight of your opinion and outlook. If we keep diving Jews vs Muslim we will always be at war and face discrimination. We need to unite and agree that there are good and innocent Jews and Muslims who do not deserve this. We need to agree as separate groups of people that before we are Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, we are HUMAN. And as humans, let’s come together and support justice. Let’s not support the Hamas who parade miser and rape. Support the people who have been killed and those who have been abused by the Hamas.",2023-10-08 09:57:10

The damage they have done to us is unbearable. My friends, my brothers, were brutally murdered, taken prisoner in Gaza, and all this for what? Because we want to live in **one** country of Jews without fear?

This fear has been around for a long time and has permeated us. We are absolutely shocked.

At least now, the world is with us. The world is on our side. And we are going to win. They declared war.

I was Pro-Palestinian, still kinda am because I think Israel should drive its settlers out of west bank and give more autonomy to West Bank and Gaza and make 2 state-solution. But after watching today's videos, i can't possibly deny that Hamas are fucking terrorists. They're taking young jewish girls as hostages, who have nothing to do with the politics. They're slaughtering any Israeli who comes their way, they are entering people's homes and killing them in their houses. They aren't sparing anyone-not the women or the children. They are parading dead bodies of Israelis. This is FUCKING DISGUSTING AND VILE. This is not resistance, this is terrorism..

But you know, what I found even more disgusting and horrifying than these graphic videos? I'm seeing stories of Arabs online, and they're PRAISING HAMAS, they're posting videos of houses and streets burning with Quranic verses playing in the background, they're praising their ""BROTHERS"" for their bravery. This is making a pit in my stomach.

If israel wipes Gaza in the next few days, i wouldn't be surprised. And what's worse is that I know in the coming few days, so many of innocent Gazans will be killed because of this stupid Hamas",2023-10-08 09:26:22

If anything it shows that all Israel's security policies have been justified, because they are extremely dangerous.

Israel should have every right to occupy the entirety of the region, and enact a total police state. This would be to the benefit of the peaceful Palestinians too. It is clear that they cannot look after themselves, and they cannot manage to run anything, and just devolve into terrorism.

**Israel is a huge benefit to the global community.**

They are a prosperous nation, delivering technology and innovation to the benefit of the world. 

**The Palestinians offer nothing to the global community at all except endless pain, misery and destabilization.**

Just like the term ""Prussian"" has disappeared from usage, so should the term ""Palestinian"". We can still use the term Palestinian for militarism, aggressiveness and conservatism, but the people who call themselves Palestinians and want peace should dissociate from this identity that is based on nothing more than failure, terrorism and vengance.

39,39.0," No my position has not changed because It's not Israel versus Palestine. It's Israel vs Hamas. I am anti terrorism but I am also anti-apartheid. My stance has been and always will be a solution in which Israel and Palestine can live side by side peacefully.

What Hamas is doing to innocent people is wrong but to use this as a justification that all Palestinians are bad and deserve the wrath of Israel is equally wrong. It's one thing to support Israel's right to defend themselves but it should not come at the expense of the lives of innocent Palestinian people either.

The outrage people are feeling for the innocent Israelis being raped and murdered is correct but equally so all the people going on about the lack of empathy,humanity etc the jihadis are showing should have the same energy for the innocent Palestinians who suffer daily too, including women and children ( who aren't going around raping and murdering and simply trying to survive). Do you think IDF has not raped, murdered and tortured Palestinians and this is a one sided war?

Israel defending itself is one thing but they fire indiscriminately on Palestine everytime there has been an attack by Hamas. Why is one sides suffering more important than the others?

If you lose more than one conflict for your independence you have to stay on the peaceful path if you want to build your own country.

45,45.0,"Both sides have been resolving to terror. What we are seeing now, and in the past, from Hamas is without a doubt terrorism and it's despicable. 
Make no mistake that,  while I support Israel, they too have killed over 2500 Palestinian children in the last 3 years. 

Israel has a large and sophisticated military and and justifies their killing and land grab as part of their fight against terrorism, but make no mistake they have been killing Palestinians and taking their homes and lands since 1948. 
Palestinians, on the other hand, don't have the firepower to go against the Israeli military. Hence, they resolve to rerrorism. 

Neither side is innocent. they're killing civilians, and that has to stop. 

If you look at the Israelis, they're all white. Northern European White. Most of them, at least. 

All relocated from Europe after WWII. Europe didn't want the Jews so instead of ""expelling"" them, they created the state of Israel in Palestine under the pretext that this was their promised land. 

Simply, you have Jews relocating to Israel from all over the world as long as they're Jewish, they can be Israeli citizens. In 1922 there were less than 100,000 Jewish people living in Palestine.

Jews left the area 2500 years ago. 
While they do have a claim in the area, you can not ethnic cleans those who live in the area you're taking over.  

Palestinians, on the other hand, are natives of that land never moved away. 

This land grab has been going on for over 80 years. 
Give Palestine its statehood, and all these senseless wars will stop.
Both sides must coexist there's no power way. 

European powers and USA support Israel because they don't want the Jews in their countries. If they stop supporting Israel, Iran along with some Arab nations will push the Israelis out very quickly. In turn 6million Jews will be back in Europe and USA. And they simply don't want ray.

Palestine is about to suffer some vicious reprisals and nobody in the world is going to step in because they've brought this one on themselves.

People can only be pushed so far before they push back however they can, and I have yet to see any civil war or other similar conflict between people rather than armies that didn't look pretty much exactly like this. Is it unfortunate that civilians are dying? Absolutely, but that was always true, and the crimes being perpetrated now are no different than the ones that came before, just reversed and packed into a shorter time. Whether you believe it's morally right or wrong, what has been done to the Palestinians for years and decades is a far greater suffering than anything Hamas could ever inflict back in days or weeks, and I think it's important for people to understand that. This did not happen in a vacuum, this did not happen unprovoked, and despite how cruel and/or vicious it is, it's not a *disproportionate* response in its scale (like what tends to happen in the other direction, and likely will in this case too). I just hope this incident galvanises enough of the right people to bring them to the table and actually deliver positive, meaningful resolution to a conflict that has stagnated and become more hopeless than ever, but I'm not holding my breath.

My thoughts (preface I’m still working through this so I might mis-type) - I feel as though when I look at Israeli injustice, it’s doesn’t land the same way because of intentionality.

Israel did not build the separation barriers and blockade for no reason, they did so in reaction to fatah and hamas violence respectively. Therefore when I see Palestinians being harmed I know intellectually it is wrong and disproportionate, but my subconscious goes “well, it’s happening due to Israel’s overreaction, not because Israel wants to harm the Palestinians in question”

When I see hamas fighters gang raping, kidnapping, mass executioning etc, the intention IS to harm civilians. Therefore there is a more visceral response. Even though Palestinians have objectively had it worse.

I knew from an early age that wandering into the wrong neighboring city would have meant my death, my torture, and would likely end with my lifeless body being dragged through the streets by a cheering mob. My teenage hangouts, my city buses, were bombed by deranged people who strapped bombs to their chests. People in my life were murdered - driving on the highway, eating pizza, or just sleeping in their homes. This has happened many times before, just not on this scale.

The difference between them is that while the State of Israel cares for it's people, Hamas does not; and this conflict has confirmed me that. Hamas has committed an absolutely insane decision in making this attack, they're committing horrifying crimes against the israeli people, while at the same time dooming the palestinians in Gaza and possibly in the whole world. And that's cause they've never cared about the palestinians more than they care about their fundamentalist islamic ""values.""

- Gaza needs to be cleansed of the Hamas so these terrorists don't have their grip and anti Semitic manipulation over the Palestinians anymore

You need to understand that among the Israeli left, there's a weird assumption that anti-Zionists are their peers and comrades, not their mortal enemies, that can't tell the difference between them and right-wing Israelis. That antisemitism and anti-Zionism are occasionally linked, like among the heads of the Iranian regime or Hamas, or Western Neo-Nazis... but certainly not among educated, liberal Westerners. That those liberal Westerners actually are what they say: mere fighters for human rights, using objective standards, that would protect me and my family, just like it protects the Palestinians. That Zionism is a done deal, and anti-Zionism is the basically the same as left-wing Zionism. Opposing the settlements, supporting a two-state solution, supporting peace.

Hearing how very educated, eloquent actual anti-Zionists talk, made me realize that I was believing in complete nonsense. Even when the anti-Zionists who didn't shoot a single bullet in the back of an old lady's head, or slit a single Jewish child's throat, are tantamount to, say, white supremacists. People who believe in an ideology that's fundamentally not acceptable, and if implemented would lead to horrible atrocities against me and my family.

Israel should give aid money for relocation for those who leave willingly.  But otherwise, Israel is justified by clearing out people by force.

Muslims will never stop as their religion tells them not to. So what are people supporting when they support these muslim causes?  How do they see these conflicts ending eventually?

The only time muslims will chill out is when they are the only ones left on earth. Thats is a fact and dont let a sly sneaky lying imam trick you into thinking otherwise. They are the BEST at lying, weasling and changing meaning when they discuss their cult.

Why is Israel inacting apartheid? 
- Palestinians say it is because Israelies are Zionists who want to control and eliminate them.
- Israel says it is to confine terrorists and ensure safety for their citizens

What do the Israelis want? 
 - Israelis say they want to live in their original homeland without persecution. A democratic state.
- Palestinians say Israelies want to cleanse them from their land and create a Jewish state. 

What do Palestinians want?
- Palestinians say they just want their homes back.
-Israelies say Palestinians want to take over and create a theocratic state devoid of Christians and jews. 


I think there is truth to both sides of these arguments, but the way this attack has gone, it is becoming clear where the true motivations lie.  Israel could have wiped out Palestinians if they wanted to. It would be easy. Israelies are nice enough to call before bombing targets and use precision munitions to minimize casualties. Meanwhile, Palestinians fire rockets indiscriminately and, when given the opportunity, murder and kidnap civilians directly. 

Their constant Allah akbar wails and religious chants drives home the fact that this is not about freedom.. it's about Jihad... about theocratic control. It is not illegal to be Muslim in Israel, that was never their goal.

Just like the argument that the ""Civil War was about states rights"" leads to the rhetorical question ""states rights to do what?""   The argument that ""Hamas fights for freedom of palestinians."" ""Freedom to do what?""

Both sides have delusional religious motivations, but there is a very clear ""lesser of two evils"" here. The veil of the poor downbeaten underdog fighting for freedom has been pulled off.

256,256.0,"This is such a complicated subject. It is incredibly interesting to me, I am a Canadian with no religious ties. I sympathize heavily with Jewish people and their continual oppression over the last few millennium.

After the 1947 UN backed partition plan of the British Mandate for Palestine, Arab Nations immediately declared war on Israel with the intend on seizing all of the newly formed Jewish State and the absolute rejection of the UN Partition Plan. One can argue that the lack of Arab consultation during the Partition Plan lead to its ultimate rejection among Arabs. Understand two things, firstly, the UK (which administered the Mandate for British Palestine prior to the 1947 Partition) was in a terrible economic and social condition from WW2 and thus eager to rid itself of the responsibility of administering what was rapidly turning into a warzone, and secondly Zionist movements were arguably more political organized and thus were able to advocate better for themselves at the UN, which are the time was mostly a European-dominated entity. These two aspects greatly reduced Arab, or non-jewish consultation during Partition Talks. I believe that this is one of reasons why Arab Nations, and the Arabs within partitioned Palestine/Israel decided to invade in 1947/1948. Again, the British had to decolonize their former holdings and just left, with all of their military (which were holding the peace) after the partition was finalized.

There are radical sects of both Arab/Palestine Nationalist groups and Zionist Nationalist groups. If you want a two state solution than these extremist/terrorist groups need to be dissolved or less the cycle of violence will just continue. These extremist political groups are the main barrier to a two state solution, there have been documented examples of extremist groups from both sides sabotaging peace talks. Radical sects like Hamas are the enemy of normalization, just as some far right zionist groups are. I have never seen this conflict as black and white, there are bad actors on both sides. 

Yesterday was awful, truly awful. I fully expect the IDF to invade Gaza and systematically root out Hamas. I think it is warranted as Hamas is the elected political party in Gaza. I am not sure what Israel will do with the inhabitants of Gaza, there are 2 million people there. Maybe it will be administered similarly to how the West Bank is. I think this will lead to a walking back of normalization of relations between other Middle Eastern Countries and Israel. Depending on the US's involvement, this could lead to another 1973 energy crisis. Though I am not sure how likely that is, but it is possible. 

I think as time goes on, it becomes less and less likely of a two state solution. I think it is the best solution still. Hamas does not represent the collective Palestinian opinion, it is a fringe extremist group. I do think it is inevitable that Palestinians (especially in Gaza) will radicalize and the cycle will continue unless something changes. However, is compromise something that people are interested in, I am talking from both sides. I don't think so.

If people are interested in this subject, I would highly recommend listening to the Matyrmade Podcast series on the history of Palestine/Israel leading up to 1947.

Thinking they do is the same islamophobia that was rampant in the US after 9/11 when people acted like Al-Qaeda represented all Muslims. Hamas has obviously done some horrible horrible things. They need to be stopped. But they do not represent all Palestinians

Israel also isn’t innocent. They have bullied  Palestine for 75 years. They have done a lot of awful things during that time. They have filled wells that Palestinians used for water with concrete, they have raided mosques for no reason. They have committed war crimes against them. For example: in 2009 Israel used white phosphorus against civilians in Gaza. If you don’t know, white phosphorus is an incendiary munition. When it contacts air, not only does it ignite, but it immediately covers everything in smoke. In addition to the burning it can also cause brain injuries, but it also sticks to skin and clothes. The use of it near civilians is illegal and therefore it is a war crime to use it like Israel did. And now they’re killing Palestinian civilians just like Hamas is doing

297,297.0,"The history of Israel covers an area of the Southern Levant also known as Canaan, Palestine or the Holy Land, which is the geographical location of the modern states of Israel and Palestine. From a prehistory as part of the critical Levantine corridor, which witnessed waves of early humans out of Africa, to the emergence of Natufian culture c. 10th millennium BCE, the region entered the Bronze Age c. 2,000 BCE with the development of Canaanite civilization, before being vassalized by Egypt in the Late Bronze Age. In the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were established, entities that were central to the origins of the Jewish and Samaritan peoples as well as the Abrahamic faith tradition.This has given rise to Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, Druzism, Baha'ism, and a variety of other religious movements. Throughout the course of human history, the Land of Israel has come under the sway or control of various polities, and as a result, it has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups.

In the following centuries, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian Empires conquered the region. The Ptolemies and the Seleucids vied for control over the region during the Hellenistic period. However, with the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty, the local Jewish population maintained independence for a century before being incorporated into the Roman Republic.As a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, many Jews were killed, displaced or sold into slavery.Following the advent of Christianity, which was adopted by the Greco-Roman world under the influence of the Roman Empire, the region's demographics shifted towards newfound Christians, who replaced Jews as the majority of the population by the 4th century. However, shortly after Islam was consolidated across the Arabian Peninsula under Muhammad, Byzantine Christian rule over the Land of Israel was superseded by the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. From the 11th century to the 13th century, the Land of Israel became the centre for intermittent religious wars between Christian and Muslim armies as part of the Crusades. In the 13th century, the Land of Israel became subject to the Mongol invasions and conquests, though these were locally routed by the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule it remained until the 16th century. The Mamluks were eventually defeated by the Ottoman Empire, and the region became an Ottoman province until the 20th century.

The late 19th century saw the widespread consolidation of a Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism, as part of which aliyah (Jewish return to the Land of Israel from the diaspora) increased. During World War I, the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the Allies led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine.

Arab nationalism opposed this design, asserting Arab rights over the former Ottoman territories and seeking to prevent Jewish migration. As a result, Arab–Jewish tensions grew in the succeeding decades of British administration.

A decent number of Muslims will blindly defend Muslims no matter what. Again not saying good or bad, just the way it is.

Correct me if I am wrong, the ummah transcend all race, national ties, etc. It is meant to unify Muslims under one religious banner. So because of this, Muslims have a sense of community like no other religion. 

This, combined with regular intake of propaganda that dehumanizes the ""enemy"", makes Muslims support other Muslims no matter what and they cannot see wrong in what other Muslims actions.

Once again, not all Muslims live by this or are like this, just a decent number of them do. Like I said, for the community of Muslims, it has it's positive perks for them and negative perks for them/others sometimes. Just how it is.

It doesn’t help that some groups immediately jumped to “Israel started it” rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don’t understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism.

So then people didn't listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal.

1. **Political Context**:  Hamas has both political and militant wings. While some countries, including the United States and Israel, designate it as a terrorist organization, others do not. Some nations and entities view Hamas as a legitimate political entity representing the Palestinian people.

2. **Historical Background**:  Hamas was formed in the late 1980s in response to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. It evolved from a grassroots movement seeking to resist occupation.

3. **Election and Governance**: Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, gaining legitimacy as a political entity. This shows that it has a level of popular support within the Palestinian territories.

4. **Ceasefire and Negotiations**: various times, Hamas has expressed willingness to engage in ceasefire agreements with Israel, indicating a potential shift towards a more diplomatic approach.

5. **Critique of Israeli Policies**: Some critics contend that labeling Hamas as solely a terrorist group can overlook underlying issues, such as the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the socio-economic challenges faced by Palestinians.

6. **Humanitarian Perspective**:  The impact of Israeli policies on the lives of Palestinians, and how this can lead to support for Hamas as a resistance force.

594,594.0,"I’m an American. We had a similar situation play out on September 11th, 2001; when hijackers flew two commercial airliners into the largest towers in America in New York City, as well as the Pentagon — a government agency/building. This was an act committed by Islamic extremists, following the command of Osama bin Laden; the leader of Al Quaeda.

Many lost their lives that day, whether from direct impact from the planes, smoke inhalation, the towers collapsing, or those that decided to take their own lives rather than burn in the flames attacking the buildings. We hated after that. We hated anyone we could get our hands on, shifting the blame not only to various countries, not just to Muslims, but to Arabs as a whole.

We spent 20 years hating them for what they did, and we hunted them down and killed them. We killed their followers, their competitors, their successors, and their allies — and we paid back the blood from that day a thousand times over.

From that experience, I will tell you this. I’m sorry. It hurts, I know it does. It won’t get better or easier any time soon, and I won’t lie to you and tell you it will. But what I will say is this:

*Don’t let hate consume you.*

Hate Islam, hate Hamas, but don’t hate everyone around you. Don’t shift the blame until you can barely tell who really attacked who or when. Don’t go overboard, you won’t come back up for a long time if you do. Don’t hate your neighbors, hate those that support these deplorable acts, and hate those that committed them. Nobody else.

630,630.0,"Hamas is centered in Gaza. Hamas has been the government there for over 15 years after massacring the opposition. Fatah. Fatah wanted two separate states. Hamas reason d'etre is to wipe Israel from the map to bring about Judgement day.

How do you know this? Hamas has in its chartered mandate to a) wipe out the state of Israel and b) in the process, kill any Jews that remain. 

Hamas regularly and systematically murders any dissidents who support an Israeli state. 

Hamas purposefully launches its attacks from schools and hospital roofs so that any counterattack results in maximum civilian casualties. The goal of this is to break down peace talks (it already worked to break down the Abraham Accords). 

Thus, Hamas is at its very core a terrorist organization equivalent to ISIS and similar. 

Israel cannot let this continue and thus has said ""get out of Gaza, we are coming"". Aid is also available upon the release of prisoners. Of course, Israel knows that Hamas will not release them, and in fact wants its people to suffer to create outrage with other Muslim communities.

World War II: The US, to save military lives, dropped two atomic bombs with an enemy that undoubtedly would have surrendered. 

Israel is facing a much more radical enemy, and for 1 week dropped bombs with warning dummy missiles and cut off supplies. Israel's response has been far more constrained.

632,632.0,"Yes, everyone is taking crazy pills, so to speak. Or rather. What you are seeing is the result of several things -- algorithmic bias pushing extreme takes both now and for years -- an increasing us vs them mentality all over the world from all sides - the proliferation of worldviews that see all things as a matter of a good guy and a bad guy in black and white terms that tends to happen during periods of crisis and uncertainty which the past decade absolutely has been for everyone.

Both sides ALSO have both overt and covert, direct and indirect propaganda campaigns at work. There are a lot of people with a strong agenda to make this as simple and onesided as possible.

You also have third party actors who have been running campaigns to increase division and keep the conversation as hostile as possible -- think about the bot farms found to trying to exacerbate tensions in the US and UK -- posting extremes on both sides not for a specific outcome but just for the tension and division. They're here too.

You are also seeing deeply held convictions and anger. In the middle of extreme events, people often adopt a strong ""if you are not with us you are against us"" position. Super hate that anyone older than 25 will know that line from Bush post 9/11 and act like thats the first time it was uttered but it sure was a time it was uttered. What the US did post 9/11 needs to STOP coming up, just as I wish people would stop bringing up other conflicts, present and past.

You also have a lot of people glibly playing this like a rhetorical game instead of the disaster and loss of life it is. These people are not worth your time to try to communicate with and yet they get a lot of views. Backseat generals and war spectators have always existed.

This situation is incredibly complicated. Complicated things are mangled the most in attempts to communicate.

The online space, specifically, has fallen into this pattern of trying to read into what people DON'T say and attack for that. What's that tweet -- if you say ""I like pancakes"" someone will say ""SO YOU DON'T LIKE WAFFLES THEN"". Except you know, with horrific human suffering and complex geopolitics.

A lot of people are casual tourists in activism and reactivism. They don't know the context, but they feel they have a firm belief in justice. A lot of them are jumping in off all the info they're getting from the situation above.

All that being said. You also have a situation where you can't just say ""They should just stop."" And people will get upset at you for saying ""what if no violence"" without understanding the reasons for the violence. Saying ""no violence"" in the middle of an exchange of violence doesn't go over well.

For what its worth, you can and should be heartbroken and horrified by the death of innocents. And people are trying to harden their hearts against one side for a variety of reasons. Sure could right a lot about the context of that phrase but... this post is too long

But you can hold the suffering of innocents in your heart and be horrified and still come away with different ""so what now"" positions. many people do. And are. They do not rise to the top. And they get attacked for the reasons above.

There are diversities of thought, but they are hard to find. There are literal families of the victims begging for peace. You have to remember most people in Gaza right now are without an ability to post their pleas - you're seeing the people who have outsider cameras pointed at them, motivated by all the above.

I've written a lot and still not given you even most of it.

TLDR -- extreme positions rise algorithmically to the top, tensions and passions are high, nuance is the first casualty of war, people will read more into any statement you make because other people are hiding behind those statements, and ""the death of innocents is bad"" is not a policy or course of action proposal.

More people agree with you than it appears. Don't lose your compassion. But compassion itself is not a course of action. Thats what makes this complicated.",2023-10-13 17:43:25

All are leaving out crucial details and happenings that make a messy thing messier, there's no wholly moral ""winning"" move in this conflict.

Recent events are a combination of thousands of years of history, religious conflict, governmental corruption and power plays, hundreds of years of distrust.

I say this as a humanitarian person, and someone who previously and still sorta does support the Palestinian people, at least in theory. Reality doesn't support a good end.

It is ignorant to blindly support the Palestinian people if they wont eject Hamas, if they actively support them, parading around corpses of israli's and tourists, of children, women and elderly, allow them to tunnel under their neighborhoods and fire rockets and mortars at israel.

Hamas hides within the civilian population, and the population doesn't eject them or fight them. Hamas has a proven track record of turning humanitarian aid and foreign provided infrastructure to make weapons and money, to run a war against Jewish people in proxy of ethno-states themselves in proxy to larger war and chaos waging nations. Israel has no responsibility to protect a people who would rather see them dead, and yet for years they have provided them with power, water, food, and electricity, and even work.

Israel drop leaflets to encourage evacuation or at the least sheltering when they have finally been forced to go in, and Hamas tells the people to stay. Not that there's actually anywhere to go.  Israel provides warnings for the airstrikes, and Hamas tells them to stay, and they stay, while they themselves flee like rats to their tunnels to fire more rockets from hospitals, schools, refugee camps, and places of worship.

I think it's also rather telling that not one nation, not even those supplying Hamas weapons, nor those supplying humanitarian aid, or those that allow them to openly smuggle weapons in through their territory actually wants to take the Palestinian people in, for a variety of reasons including the population being traumatized into contentiousness, meanwhile Palestinian expats and refugees(not all, obviously) actively call for the deaths of israeli's and jews in their host nations, threaten places of worship and people on the streets.

The killings were brutal and indiscriminate: the Algerian insurgents killed in totally random way and executed racist and brutal French settlers who mistreated the indigenous people, along with innocent women or children who had no guilt.

The massacre had been carried out by Algerian independence guerrillas with the idea of ​​exasperating French colonists and soldiers, who became even more racist than before and carried out mass executions of Algerian civilians accused of the attacks.

If you haven't lived under the oppression of the IDF and haven't suffered the losses of children, brother/sisters, mothers/fathers and so on then you have the luxury of being able to think that.

For the people actually on the ground though, they have seen first hand the carnage wrought and it is seared into their very being. Since 2008 and up until just prior to the current conflict Palestinian civilians have suffered **3,803** fatalities while Israeli civilian fatalities were **177**. That is not a typo. And that's only fatalities. That's not to mention all tens of thousands of people injured and maimed, with many never to fully recover. Then consider that Gaza has been under a brutal blockade for 17 years.

Source: [https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#)

No nation or body of people could look at those figures and say ""Well my adversary has killed 3,800 of our civilians while we've killed 177 of them. That's perfectly fine!"" What do they have to show for their restraint? How does that comport to the idea of proportionality in warfare? Israel accuses their enemies of using human shields, but the word shield implies some sort of protection. A protection that is non-existent as the IDF has shown virtually no restraint in bombing targets that result in massive civilian death tolls including those of women and children.

*So you're suggesting Israel can't defend itself?*

Imagine if an attempted bank robbery that turned into a hostage situation occurred in your country. And imagine that instead of negotiating or storming the building with small arms equipped soldiers, your police department called in an airstrike killing hostage and perpetrator alike. Would that be an acceptable outcome? Are those the actions of a responsible government?

*They aren't* ***my*** *civilians and besides they voted for Hamas*

Hamas was voted in in 2006 with 76% voter turnout. They campaigned not as Hamas but as the **Change and Reform** party. Out of those that voted, 45% voted for Hamas and polls conducted after the election indicated that the main reason they voted them in was not to escalate with Israel but rather to combat corruption. In fact, 79.5% were in favor of pursuing a peace agreement with Israel. That translates to a lot of civilians who either didn't vote for Hamas or wanted nothing to do with the extremist ideology.

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006\_Palestinian\_legislative\_election#Opinion\_polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election#Opinion_polls)

Hamas has not held elections since then and thanks to meddling from GW Bush and co., Hamas took control of the Gaza strip. In fact, had GW Bush not pressed for elections back in 2006 Hamas may have never taken control.

While it is true that Hamas in Gaza enjoys about 45% support based on a [March 2023 survey](https://pcpsr.org/en/node/938) it's important to note that **half the Gazan population is 19 or younger**. That means that 50% of the population was only 4 years old or younger when the elections took place and therefore **they never had any say in the current government** and all they know is life under the blockade.

*Israel is the more responsible party because they use ""knocking"" before bombing*

Israel's use of knocking in the current conflict appears to be vastly reduced from prior conflicts:

More importantly, roof knocking is not designed to reduce casualties, but rather to make Israel's slaughter of civilians appear more palpable to western audiences. The truth is the roof knocking was not an effective tactic. Sometimes the ""knock"" round missed the final target and those times when the warning munitions did hit they were often misinterpreted or mistaken in the cacophony of bursting munitions that civilians had to endure. Even during times when civilians did correctly interpret the message they could have as little as 5 minutes to evacuate before the killing blow was delivered. (warnings were estimated to have proceed bombings anywhere from 5-45 minutes)

Source: [https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/22/u-n-israeli-roof-knocks-did-not-provide-effective-warning-to-gaza-civilians/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/22/u-n-israeli-roof-knocks-did-not-provide-effective-warning-to-gaza-civilians/)

Also consider that in Israel virtually all citizens are mandated to serve in the military meaning these are not ordinary civilians. When the US used nukes to bomb Japan in WW2, one of the justifications cited was that in the event of invasion the Japanese population would be mobilized and militarized. Israel is a militarized society.

Furthermore, the rules of warfare are only as relevant as

A) both participants largely adhere to them

B) those rules are fair to the participants

As the civilian casualty figures show and as they freely admit now, Israel has nothing but contempt for the rules of war:

*Gallant said that he had ordered “a complete siege of the Gaza Strip,” which is home to 2.2 million Palestinians, nearly half of them children. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” he said. “We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.”*

*What Gallant ordered — the collective punishment of a civilian population — amounts to a war crime under international law, as well as potentially a crime against humanity and the crime of genocide, some international law experts have pointed out.*

Understandably emotions are running high on both sides.

But eventually smart people must take leadership.

Evil begets evil. Killing more civilians and children than hamas did does not bring Israeli victims back to life.

Bombing Gaza, turning off water, denying medicine also does not ""eradicate"" hamas. On the contrary it basically ensures that there is a huge fresh supply of young people  ready to sign up to a new hamas or even something worse.

Laying siege to Gaza like a medieval style computer game is not ""fighting terrorism"" or making ""Jews safe"", it is encouraging crazy people all around the globe to sign up to their local fanatic group and carry out attacks on jewish businesses, jewish families everywhere.

If Israel cannot distinguish between gaza children and crazy hamas killers, why should anyone else in the world make a distinction between normal Jews and Israel state war crimes?

Netanjahu is probably the worst leader Israel has ever had.

The Holocaust is one of the single worst events that have happened to an entire race. Yet there is not enough empathy and maturity in the world to make people stop joking about the word jew.

Having land forcibly taken from them at whim, earth moving machines appearing and then being forced to move to an overpopulated ghetto.

858,858.0,"I don't agree with Israel cutting off water, power, and resources to all people in the Gaza strip and using collective punishment to cause a whole group of people to starve, and live in conditions without power.

I think HAMAS is terrible for what they did to the Israelites. There's a video I saw of a woman behind a pickup truck and her legs arms were bent upside down and every Palestinian in the video spat on her corpse, it was very awful and sad and it made me angry when I taught to myself if that was my girlfriend, how sad and unfair it would be to see somebody that you love be turned into an object that all these people treat like trash.

But when I learn about the conditions that the people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have suffered for the last decades, and I look at the conditions they live in now and how they are treated as second class citizens in Israel I start the sympathize also with the Palestinians. Palestinians in Gaza are not able to do trade with other nations, their water and power are controlled by Israel, Netanyahu has increased settlements in the West Bank, increased police military presence in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians have a 50% unemployment, and the Palestinians has suffered way more [causalities](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987) over the course of this war than Israel. 

Israel is a world power that has  a top three intelligence agency, nuclear weapons, and international aid from power allies while Palestine is barely a country with no army, no electricity, and no water. Israel are the bigger person in this dynamic, they should act like it. I think what they should do is bargain for the hostages and put up walls around the Gaza strip and the West Bank.

871,871.0,"I think Israel got played. They went dark enough, evil enough and Machiavellian enough to force a dead-end move by Israel. Saturday was the start of a 50 year war that can be won by no one.  


In a book there is a description of the 9th circle of hell where the ground is frozen and people are entombed in it. At the center is Hitler and Stalin, each grabbing the other by the hair and shoulder, raking deep bloody groves into the skin and flesh of the other. Their eyes are bulging, their mouths are frozen in an open scream which has been silenced by the ice in which they are submerged, and their faces are contorted with hatred.  


Now the thing is that though they are stuck in the ice, over time they can move. So if either one would release the other, both could make it out of the ice. But they don't. The hate is too strong and the lust for vengeance is overpowering all other emotion or consideration. They are each other's captives but each is also the warden of their own prison.  


I know the parallel is not the same. Israel is no Stalin analogue. But you have to admit that not every punitive policy Israel has enacted since 1946 has been necessary as a political or military strategic action. And I also know that the hardest thing about this issue is that this is not a 50/50 issue like that of Hitler and Stalin in the ice. It's more like 70/30 or 80/20. But none the less, fair or not, they hold each other in the ice. Even if in the end Israel can never escape the ice, only Palestine.  


Obviously I do not advocate Israel to simply lie down and die, allowing a strong Palestine state to slaughter their people. Never. I would never ever say that. What I am advocating is not to do what they're about to do because it will lead to disaster. Find another way. Find an alternative. Anything.

You cannot treat people as second class citizens for generations whilst stealing their land and expect them to take it lying down. Again, the actions of Hamas last week are horrendous. Israel's reaction - move 1.1 million people in 24 hours - is ridiculous, considering their water, food, energy have already been cut off. What about people in hospital?

The incident from last week is Horrific for all sides that includes Israel, Occupied Palestine territories, and the people of Gaza who are caught in the crossfire.

There's no excuse for WAR or what happened.

End the Occupation, resolve the question of Palestine now, not later, not tomorrow. Otherwise, the cycle will continue, and we'll be back on reddit talking about this next year or 5 years from now with the same narrative.

Now that's an animal. You think you have no culpability when you treat humans that way for over god knows how many generations?

Second, HAMAS is who attacked you, and NOBODY (a far as the average Jane or Joe) is standing with Hamas. 

Third, LGBTQ+ may be standing up for Palestinians while being critical of Israel because they know what oppression is and can clearly see that Netanyahu's new regime is steadily moving toward that to include them with his current dismantling of the Israeli Judicial system.

This lose of innocent lives will anger a lot of Palestinians, which pushes them to the side of Hamas. War is the only way how Hamas can survive, since that is the only thing they can. They are worthless rulers and are hated for that.

It is a downward spiral that will not end and will continue, unless we change something. Change is possible when we would stop polarize everything.

915,915.0,"So let me put the History of your Army Straight along with your govering party so you will not forget it

I shared it before, but here we go again

Short after [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Balfour\_declaration\_unmarked.jpg): The British promise for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”, a paramilitary organization called Haganah was created to achieve this promise. Its original purpose was to defend Jewish settlements, from the Liberation movement of Arabs who were living in what was then Mandate Palestine.

Despite being an armed force, restraint was a strategic policy used by the Haganah members with regard to their activities, and they weren't really that radical.

This Changed When The British Government issued the [White paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_Paper\_of\_1939), which severely slowed down Jewish settlement in Palestine.

As a Reaction, Haganah Turned to bombing and sabotage (In 1940 a Haganah bomb sunk the ocean liner SS Patria, killing 267 people).


After Israel declared its independence, Haganah was dissolved and basically became the core of the IDF.


But going a few steps back, Haganah's restraint policy was objected to by the most radical and extremist members because it appeared defeatist to them. These radicals split off and formed the group Irgun, and from this one split off another group Called Lehi.


Irgun with a symbol of [hand holding a rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irgun.png), believed that force is the only way to liberate the homeland. And was best known for The bombing of The King David Hotel (91 Killed).

Irgun was described as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, British and American governments.

Lehi's declared aim was to build a ""new totalitarian Hebrew republic"". They were extreme right-wing in their views and soaked in racism, their publications often described Jews as a “master race”. Lehi was Best know for the assassination of Lord Moyn, as well as the UN Swedish mediator Folke Bernadotte.

Lehi referred to its members as terrorists and admitted to have carried out terrorist attacks.

And Both of them carried out the [massacre of Dier Yassin]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir\_Yassin\_massacre) (107 Killed).


After the creation of Israel, the IDF was created, merging Haganah, Irgun, Lehi under one wing.


So What has some paramilitary groups to do with Netanyahu’s party?

Well, The former members of Irgun went on to form Herut, a Far-Right party (became Right-Wing afterward) that took part in Israel’s first election, The party was headed by Menachem Begin, an Ex-member of Haganah and former Commander of Irgun.


Worth mentioning That after the creation of Herut an [open letter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New\_Palestine\_Party;\_Visit\_of\_Menachen\_Begin\_and\_Aims\_of\_Political\_Movement\_Discussed) signed by a number of prominent Jewish Intellectuals, (Including Albert Einstein) condemned Herut as ""akin to Nazi and fascist parties"", and as a ""terrorist party"".

And its Leader was noted as ""leader of the notorious terrorist organisation"" by the British government and [banned](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5025439?v=1621559450796) from entering the United Kingdom.


After years of being active on the political floor, in 1973 Herut merged with other parties to form the Likud party, a name that you may already have heard of.

By 1977 they had grown in influence to win the election, And Menachem Begin came First.

Yes, the “leader of the notorious terrorist organization” Irgun, who had ruled the denounced ""terrorist, fascist"" party Herut, became Prime Minister of Israel.

Menachem was regarded as The Godfather Of [Israeli settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\_settlement) in the West-Bank and Gaza Strip.


Surprisingly in 1980 (during his rule time), the Israeli government gave amnesty to all Lehdi Members. And rewarded them with Lehdi Ribbon as recognition of their efforts to establish Israel. So literally they were forgiving and rewarding themselves for the crimes and terrorism they commit, meanwhile denouncing as “terrorist” every group trying to get back Palestine.


Due to health conditions, Menachem was forced to step aside and hand over the reins to a comrade-in-arms Yitzhak Shamir, Who was a former Irgun member, until he had moved to Lehi to become its leader.

So the leadership of Israel was switched from the hand of a former terrorist to another former terrorist.

Yitzhak ended up serving for 7 years to become the third longest-serving prime minister in the history of Israel.


Likud lost power to The labor party represented by Yitzhak Rabin (a former member of Haganah) but not for so long, a new challenger from the Likud party led a great effort to take the power again. By accusing Rabin’s government of being ""removed from Jewish tradition”, because of Olso’s peace accord that had been made between Palestinians and Israelis. The new challenger led a mock funeral procession featuring a coffin and hangman's noose at an anti-Rabin rally where protesters chanted, ""Death to Rabin"".

Rallies organized by Likud and other right-wing groups as objections to the Oslo accord.

And on the 4th of November 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing extremist Yagil Amir, Short after that, the chair was free for Benjamin Netanyahu.

Netanyahu lost power in 1999 and stepped aside from the political screen for a while, get back to the chair in 2009, and held it ever since to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel while leading a party that was born from terrorist roots.

This extremism and terrorism aspect in the Likud’s idealogy, and in the idealogy of its former leader (former terrorist with “Fascism” and xenophobia) explains why the government has been acting in this way. The IDF was made by a conjunction of these terrorist groups, that's why we see this inherited violence and brutality in them.

The first election was in 1949 from that time till now (75 years) almost half of it (35 years) was under the control of the Likud. It is really surprising how a party and its leaders with such “dirty” history could stay so long in a decision's position, In fact, how did they grab this position in the first place ?!

Israel’s policies, decisions, and the military has been seized by extremists and chauvinists whose groups and acts were condemned by many countries and by Israel itself.

It is frightening how they try to bound Zionism and Israel with the Jewish identity, to the point, it becomes almost impossible to criticize them or their acts and policies without being accused of antisemitism.",2023-10-13 11:50:20

From the American media (even the least biased outlets), news coverage continues to dehumanize people in Gaza, and it’s clear that it’s working. I keep hearing about claims from Israel that end up being proven false, although I am aware that innocent Israelis still are afraid and suffering. On the other hand, I keep seeing live coverage by civilians of countless videos of widespread destruction of multiple neighborhoods in Gaza and the deformed bodies of dead children covered in dust. If you question the humanity of civilians in Gaza, consider the fact that half of the population are children and the whole population has been dehumanized and collectively traumatized for far too long. On social media I see posts that either don’t mention civilians in Gaza or call them animals and barbarians… then I see footage of dead Palestinian children and the bombing of exit points while everyone is scrambling to seek refuge and stay alive. It is clear to me that the goal of the media is to dehumanize people in Gaza and by failing to acknowledge them, they are essentially grouping them all under Hamas.

It is *mostly* our fault where we’re at today.

Every nation in the history of the world has built its country on the lands of another. This is literally how the map we see today was formed.
Our big egos though refused to accept that.

Even after losing every battle *we* started to get the land back, we didn’t accept the loss and tried again, and keep trying.

If we had in 1948 accepted the reality of a two state division, we would have saved alot of time, agony and bloodshed.

Arabs and Muslims keep chanting;

From the river to the sea.. Palestine will be free.

So still after all these years.. we are the ones adamant about having *the whole land* or we keep fighting. It is lost on me how we can’t reflect on the past and learn from it. Who cares what the name of the country you live in is? Who cares what colors the flag is? As long as you live and prosper and have the freedom to practice your religion and whatever else you want.. WHO CARES???

We have lost too many lives on this land, for the right to carry a flag. How stoo. Pid! It’s a full blown lie what they taught us.. Our dignity does not lie on the land or in the colors of a flag!! Our dignity is in living our best lives, having integrity, and serving humanity.

I'm most angry at Iran and anyone else who likely enabled this attack in the wake of the Saudi Arabia-Israel normalization.

1043,1043.0,"When looking at the massacre this week, it's important to remember that Israelis has seen that many times from Hamas before. Killing people in night clubs, blowing up civilian busses, shopping malls, and so on used to be Hamas default way of action in the 90s, before Israel closed the borders. Back in the 90s, Gaza used to export fruits, vegetables to Israel, people in Israel used to go eat in restaurants in Gaza/West Bank (same way Israelis go today to Israeli-Palestinian places, and work with Israeli-Palestinian). 

Unfortunately, Hamas started doing similar acts of terrorism (See Maxim Restaurant, https://youtu.be/KoHRwlHEHbQ, Dolphinarium Massacre https://youtu.be/wlQKMOvmaLc, and many others https://www.gov.il/en/Departments/General/suicide-and-other-bombing-attacks-since-the-declaration-of-principles), so Israel's response was to close the border, and later (2005) completely disconnect from Gaza and let Gazans rule Gaza. 

Unfortunately, instead of creating a prosperous city state, this caused a civil war in Gaza (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)) causing at least 118 Palestinians to be killed by other Palestinians. The Hamas won. And stayed in power to this day.

This caused both Israel and Egypt to stop cooperating with Gaza, which in turn made the economic situation in Gaza worse. With Hamas leaders getting net worths of billions of $ (Ismail Haniyeh's net worth is over $4 billion, and other Palestinian leaders are not far behind https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-the-phenomenal-wealth-of-hamas-leaders-1000957953, or search on Tiktok/X #GazaYouDontSee).

While the media tries to separate Hamas from Gazans, unfortunately Hamas couldn't operate if not for the support of civilians. And they get civilian support by starving and leaving them without work, by diverting donations, inventing employees and pocketing their salaries, by withdrawing supplies and creating deficiency, and blaming it on Israel, while buying luxury cars and building mansions in Gaza, Qatar and Egypt.

So while Saturday's massacre of civilians is devastating, it's actually nothing new from Gazan and Hamas. The only thing that changed, is that unfortunately, when Hamas was doing those atrocities in the past, there was no social media and camera phones to record it. And the news are easy to be bought. By the time social media appeared, Israel blocked Gaza, disengaged, made harsher security protocol and built Iron dome. So the number of casualties in Israel went down, while in Gaza went up. Until Saturday, that is. We're back in 2001, with Hamas killing civilians in parties, restaurants and night clubs, but this time there is social media to document it.",2023-10-10 06:23:21

With each successive violent eruption, I'm actually pushed a little farther to the left. I've always considered myself a Zionist because I identify with the classical definition written by Leon Pinsker in reaction to Jews being slaughtered in the Russian Empire. My definition of Zionism has never included death, oppression, and occupation. We can't give up. Palestinian liberation will ensure the future of Jewish liberation. We *cannot* allow the extremists and ideologues without a personal stake in the matter to pull us apart when I know the vast majority of us want peace, safety, and dignity for all.

I do not know what Israel should do or have done. I am sure that any proposal of what they could have done differently could just have easily also ended poorly for multiple peoples. 

I am also not sure how this current fighting will end. You seem to implicitly think that this will end with a bombing and go back to the old status quo. I do not think that will happen. When things like this have happened in the past, Israel has usually increased security measures, building protective walls and checkpoints and increasing occupation forces. They will do this for their own safety to prevent the same thing from happening again. This will almost certainly be a tragedy for the people of Gaza who will be impacted. I would not be at all surprised if the current conflict ends with Gaza being occupied. 

I do not see a possible good path forward on the short term.",2023-10-10 11:35:55

When you stop thinking of it as an ""occupation"", and start thinking of the Palestinians as a ""conquered people"" everything is a lot clearer.

Israel defeated them militarily. You had a fair war with Israel, who was surrounded and outnumbered and yet they won.

Just like the allies defeated the Nazis in WW2.

The Nazis were not left to roam free in Germany. They were occupied until these extreme elements were flushed out.

If you ask the Nazis if they were provoked, they could make all kinds of excuses, just like the Palestinians.

The Palestinians have never accepted defeat, and simply resort to terrorizing civilian populations. No one in the global community finds this acceptable - which is really the only thing that matters.

The Palestinians actively support an ideology as bad as the Nazis.

It is Israel's land because of military victory. They are nice to let the Palestinians stay. It's almost akin to letting Nazis stay. But if they continually agitate, they should leave.",2023-10-10 05:06:10

There are also dozens more videos of women and children being violated, tortured, drag to death behind vehicles, and beheaded.

\----------------------

The only solution to Hammas is the solution we had for ISIS. Kill all the fighters and men. Put the women and children into deprograming camps. Over 250k women and children of ISIS fighters filtered through such camps. Today only 25k remain. You can google it. There are books, news articles, documentaries and videos about it. It was the largest mass detainment of ""civilians"" since WWII. (with the participation of the west)

It was not done as retribution. It was the only way to save lives of people brainwashed into terrorist ideology. What do you do with kids who have participated in mass executions, forced or not, they are mentally scarred. What do you do with mothers who encourage children to grow up to be martyrs? It was the best solution to a horrible problem.

And I know the history of the land from other nations as well , and I know what it looked like in 1800 and who was there and what happens 400 plus years before Islam was even created. So to say occupation ,or their land is just a joke. We have tried to co exist, they had every opportunity to do that . But every time they’ve choose to annihilate us. And it happens in 1948 with 6 countries against us and after a year plus of fighting we’ve gain control of what is bigger portion of the so called 2 state solution. And it continued to a war in 56’,67’ (six day war) 73’ yom kipor , 82 Lebanon war , first intifada  90’s and the list goes on. Any country that fought for their land  , and that went to war and lost . knew that losing meant , also losing their land in the process and just look at the history books in so called Europe and how many countries at some point all ruled over majority of Europe . From Italians , French , Germans , English and the list goes on and on. Israel was among the few who actually wanted peace and after conquering Sinai ,which is almost same size of Israel . offered it back in exchange for peace!!  and we’ve made the same efforts afterwards. Now mind you this we are not only the wining side, but also strategically more stronger .but we just don’t want to keep fighting and live like that. We didn’t have the USA support then. As a matter of fact Russia helped .And we are surrounded by 20 plus muslim countries . I always promoted live and let live and let’s stop fighting .and work on make our generation better and make things to improve lives. But when Palestinians still want to eradicate Jews for just being Jews .then there’s no freaking way. They choose Hamas in 2006 and they chose fatah before that. Both so called freedom fighters who wedge, jihad war on Jewish people. So how can anyone do peace with these people?!!! Every country in our generation would not only go to war against them , but will put an end to that threat! When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and killed 2k plus people , the USA retaliated in what known one of the biggest acts of war to ever recorded. that sent a message to the whole wide world not to mess with the USA or even try. When war is Syria took place within its own people and over 250k people are dying no one makes such a big deal out of it .and I’ve seen kids getting slaughtered while most of you stayed quite while the most purest things have been murdered. So there’s no 2 state solution especially with the likes of Hamas or any other Iranian extremist who call to kill Jews for being Jews .and it doesn’t stop from Jordan to the sea , they want it everywhere! So now it’s the time to strike back and make sure it will never happen again and these actions will echo for many generations not to mess with the Jewish people again. And remember all of you can walk proud and happy in Israel even if your Arab , LBGT or any other group .but the same cannot be said not only in Gaza but other Muslim countries around the world .where you have to think twice before drinking too much , or god forbid node the wrong way , or shaking hands with the left hand , or women who are treated like property and gay people aren’t even allowed, not to mention other religions. cause they have showed us what happened in the past. So if you read history pages ,read it not only in your language. check the Quran and understand who lived in the so called Palestine land 500 years before Islam was created. Who was there before the Greek and Roman Empire. Learn about Egyptian history and who were the Jews and where did they came from. And when you know this then maybe we can have a talk about fairness. In the meanwhile watch us protect our country and people from these brutal savages. And has Golda Meir said - if we have a choice between being dead and pitted between being alive with bad image .

\- That Israel occupies Gaza. Israel left Gaza and then people there promptly voted Hamas into power.

How would the US react if ISIS set up shop in Baja Mexico? How would Egypt react? or China? I think the answer is the same.

&#x200B;

* How do these people not see the irony in calling one of the world's smallest countries a colonizer. These people seem to be especially confused about what is being colonized. Is it all of Israel including its internationally declared and recognized 1948 borders? Is it the territories conquered in 1967 when Israel was facing a military mobilization from Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan all at the same time? Please again... you tell me what you would do if you were a very tiny country  surrounded on all sides by governments who were holding rallys declaring they would sweep the Jews into the sea. 
* ""But Israel is a European implant in the Middle East"" these people would declare. Right...tell that to the more than 60% of Israelis who are from Middle Eastern countries including Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, etc. My wife and her entire family ***walked*** from Iraq after being kicked out of Baghdad in the 40s. It is ***not*** the case that Middle Eastern countries were friendly and tolerant of Jews... and it **is** the case that Israel would not be a viable state without it having become a safe-haven for Middle Eastern Jews...  I'm sorry that this complicates the ""colonizer"" narrative but again, history matters. 

But the Occupation! Let me say at the outset of this last part... I oppose the occupation. The occupation of the West Bank is unequivocally wrong. It could have and should have been done with a long time ago - just like when the Sinai was returned to Egypt in exchange for peace. 

It really is too bad that Ehud Barak offered the entirety of the West Bank and Gaza to Yassir Arafat at Camp David in 2000, and all that Israelis got in return was the 2nd Intifada. More violence, more terrorism, more slamming the door on a long term solution. People seem to have some amnesia or historical ignorance around this as well. Do you really think that Israel has some sort of imperative to just control the West Bank for the sake of it? Now 23 years later, Ehud Barak's party (and really the entire peace camp - people who believe a solution can be worked out with the Palestinians - is really dead...) So now you get Netanyahu and he really does seem content to build more settlements and annex the West Bank.... 

It's a shame but it's hard not to see how things could have worked out differently... How about if Arab leaders accepted the 1947 partition plan? What if they made peace with Israel in 1967 instead of amassing their armies on the border? What if they had done with Egypt did in brokering peace in return for the West Bank and Gaza. What if the PA had accepted the 2000 Camp David accords? It would seem that it is still true that the Palestinians ""never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity."" 

What if - in 2023 -  Palestinians would recognize that Hamas can not and should not speak for them if there is ever to be peace. People who live democracy, peace and human rights don't go door-to-door murdering civilians and taking hostages.

John F. Kennedy.

Any honest conversation about Israel and Palestine must start with this uncomfortable truth, spelled out here in a leading Israeli newspaper, because it exposes the central lie at the heart of the matter which, until you comprehend it, you can never 
make sense of anything else.

""Israel does not want peace. There is nothing I have ever written that I would be happier to be proved wrong about. But the evidence is piling up. In fact, it can be said that Israel has never wanted peace – a just peace, that is, one based on a just compromise for both sides. It’s true that the routine greeting in Hebrew is Shalom (peace) – shalom when one leaves and shalom when one arrives. And, at the drop of a hat, almost every Israeli will say he wants peace, of course he does. But he’s not referring to the kind of peace that will bring about the justice without which there is no peace and there will be no peace. Israelis want peace, not justice, certainly not anything based on universal values. Thus, “Peace, peace, when there is no peace.” Not only is there no peace: In recent years, Israel has moved away from even the aspiration to make peace.""
http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-peace-conference/1.601112#!

""Even if Mahmoud Abbas fights with all he has to prevent terror against Israelis, and declares that he knows he will only ever return to Safed, his birthplace, as a tourist; and even if he declares that the Holocaust is the gravest crime in human history – even if he does all of that, Prime Minister Netanyahu will hasten to pour a bucket of cold water on his head. 

And even if the countries of the Arab League present Israel with an initiative that could kick-start some type of peace process, that contains an explicit invitation to a new kind of dialogue we’ve never seen before, for which we’ve yearned for years – the Israeli government will totally and demonstratively ignore it for 12 years and counting. 

It’s interesting: We only seriously tried the path of peace with the Palestinians once, in 1993. It failed, and from that moment on, it’s as if Israel decided to seal off that option once and for all. Here, too, see the twisted logic of despair at work: We’ve tried the path of war, occupation, terror and hatred dozens of times, never wearying of it or giving up on it, so why the rush to permanently divorce ourselves from peace, of all things, after a single failure?""
http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-peace-conference/1.601993#!

Israel wants land, not peace. Lasting peace would require Israel to return illegally annexed Palestinian land. Israel will never do that. It’s goal is to annex ALL of their land. No matter HOW angry Palestinians become. When they become violent, Israel crushes them - and uses it to justify its actions. Meanwhile, more and more settlements are being built on stolen land. While Israel has methodically derailed every peace initiative for years:

2014: ""In April, when negotiations broke down after nine months, US Secretary of State John Kerry explicitly blamed Israel for the breakdown in talks. His special envoy, Martin Indyk, a career Israel lobbyist, blamed Israel’s insatiable appetite for Palestinian land and continued expansion of the settlements, and handed in his resignation.""
http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n15/mouin-rabbani/israel-mows-the-lawn

2014: ""The most immediate cause of this latest war has been ignored: Israel placed a prohibitive set of obstacles in the way of the Palestinian “national consensus” government. 
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/opinion/gaza-and-israel-the-road-to-war-paved-by-the-west.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar

“This is what Israel always does. Anybody who knows the history, it’s what the Israeli political scientist, the mainstream political scientist—name was Avner Yaniv—he said it’s these Palestinian “peace offensives.” Whenever the Palestinians seem like they are trying to reach a settlement of the conflict, which the unity government was, at that point Israel does everything it can to provoke a violent reaction—in this case, from Hamas—break up the unity government, and Israel has its pretext. “We can’t negotiate with the Palestinian Authority because they only represent some of the Palestinian people; they don’t represent all of the Palestinian people.” And so Netanyahu does what he always does—excuse me, what Israeli governments always do: You keep pounding the Palestinians, in this case pounding Hamas, pounding Hamas, trying to evoke a reaction, and when the reaction comes—well, when the reaction comes, he said, “We can’t deal with these people. They’re terrorists.”""
 http://www.democracynow.org/2014/7/15/after_palestinian_unity_deal_did_israel

At what point must we accept that there are no peaceful options left for the people of Gaza? That Netanyahu pulled out a re-election victory precisely by promising NO peace?

What if you’d become convinced that the official Israeli excuses to explain the occupation, built around the words “fear” and “security”, are all propaganda? That no genuine fear and security can explain settlements in the heart of a Palestinian population in the West Bank, in the heart of East Jerusalem or in Hebron? No fear and security can explain the expulsion of Palestinians from their home in favour of Jews, blacking out their cities, stealing their drinking water, surrounding them with concrete walls, directing sewage onto their crops, parents laughing as Israeli children surround Israel’s Arab children and beat them senseless with baseball bats? 

Or explain why Israel's blockade of Gaza stops people in Gaza having toilet paper, sanitary towels, light bulbs, candles, matches, books, musical instruments, crayons, clothing, shoes, mattresses, sheets, blankets, pasta, tea, coffee, chocolate, nuts, shampoo and conditioner, books and paper?

What if the day is approaching when our choices as outsiders -  after sanctions and diplomacy and international condemnation and UN pressure and economic isolation have all failed - will be to either support Israel’s continual oppression of the Palestinian people with no end in sight, or support Palestinian warriors as they wage a war of liberation against a powerful adversary? 

Can you and I, as people of good conscience, choose either?
We can and we must.

It was an Israeli ultra-nationalist terrorist who assassinated Israel's Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin for signing the Oslo Peace Accords. 

Israel has thousands of armed and militant hard-line extremists who strongly oppose peace. Israel also has extremists high inside its government who oppose peace, like Ayelet Shaked of the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, who recently called for the slaughter of Palestinian mothers who give birth to ""little snakes.""  The deputy speaker of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said Israel must attack Gaza even more mercilessly, expel the population and resettle the territory with Jews. “Gaza is part of our Land and we will remain there forever,” Moshe Feiglin concludes. “Subsequent to the elimination of terror from Gaza, it will become part of sovereign Israel and will be populated by Jews."" Feiglin has a long history of extremism. He once called for Israel to cut off electric power to dialysis patients in Gaza. 

They were elected by Israeli hardliners whose views they represent, many of them American Jews, who oppose any peace that would include returning territory. They are well-armed and extremely dangerous and ready, willing and able to take up arms against their own government if such a peace was ever agreed to. 

Some are extremely cruel to Palestinians living near their settlements, as Brian Eno witnessed in 2013:  ""I was in Israel last year with Mary. Her sister works for UNWRA in Jerusalem. Showing us round were a Palestinian - Shadi, who is her sister's husband and a professional guide - and Oren Jacobovitch, an Israeli Jew, an ex-major from the IDF who left the service under a cloud for refusing to beat up Palestinians. Between the two of them we got to see some harrowing things - Palestinian houses hemmed in by wire mesh and boards to prevent settlers throwing shit and piss and used sanitary towels at the inhabitants; Palestinian kids on their way to school being beaten by Israeli kids with baseball bats to parental applause and laughter; a whole village evicted and living in caves while three settler families moved onto their land; an Israeli settlement on top of a hill diverting its sewage directly down onto Palestinian farmland below; The Wall; the checkpoints… and all the endless daily humiliations. I kept thinking, ""Do Americans really condone this? Do they really think this is OK? Or do they just not know about it?""

sick of coal-dark nights with airplanes circling above our homes; sick of innocent farmers getting shot in the buffer zone because they are taking care of their lands; 

sick of bearded guys walking around with their guns abusing their power, beating up or incarcerating young people demonstrating for what they believe in; 

sick of the wall of shame that separates us from the rest of our country and keeps us imprisoned in a stamp-sized piece of land;

Because Palestinian refugees tried to overthrow the government of Jordan when they were welcomed there in the early 1970s. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September)

Forced to flee, they moved into Lebanon and started a civil war there in the mid-1970s.(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War)

When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, many Palestinians there celebrated, which got them expelled once Kuwait was liberated. (https://www.meforum.org/3391/kuwait-expels-palestinians)

For that, sympathy and more importantly good economic relationships with the west are a most! Especially because they will have to contend with the current east Mediterranean power (the Turks). And I guess those decades of diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt also have to be worth something.

As for the other Arab nations, (and I'm going a bit of personal opinion here) it isn't that simple. Some don't have a solid constitutional foundation, and a large wave of migrants could upset the current political climate in that country.

My Middle-Eastern modern history is a bit fuzzy but I remember in the 50’s and 60s, while all the neighbouring Arab countries were all about shoving Israel into the sea, none of them reached out to the Palestinians in any useful way. Get rid of the Jews and the Pals can settle down again. Fast forward assorted diplomatic and Israeli-centric political maneuverings and the Pals have less and less and the Israelis more. But, as Israel is the one democratic country in such a hot part of the world, the West (mostly the USA) was happy to supply whatever it could to them in arms, knowledge, etc. Call it guilt or a sound investment or both. But still, the surrounding Arab countries never raised a fuss about their Pal kinsmen. They never have. 

The PLO said and did many dreadful things and the Israelis returned it many-fold. The other Arab states did not say or do much then either. There were efforts made but nothing really changed the trajectory. Diplomates came and went, assassinations were thwarted or succeeded. Breathless articles were written as were books that “explained” everything...but they didn’t. 

I may be way off now but I remember reading somewhere (a long time ago) that the Pals were considered backward, ignorant, 2nd class citizens by the other Arab countries who all have a long glorious history of royalty and antisemitism. Remember Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran? He of the ugly beige jacket. He’s still busy in Iran’s gov. I don’t remember him being sympathetic to the Pals when he was prez of Iran. But he’d fund them. Rather like Putin’s army of meat. Just keep throwing them out there. 

Hamas and pretty much all of the Islamic organizations (religious) are dead set against a two-state solution, as is Israel, currently being run into the ground by Netanyahu who treats Israel like his own personal fiefdom and bank.

At the same time, it aims to strengthen it's ruling by collecting the votes of these refugees in the elections.  It's a devastating situation for the local people in Turkey.
I feel worried about the future of the Turkish people. Their modern and civilized country is turning into a radical Islamic country.
Let me not forget to mention this too.  European countries are very pleased with Turkey's attitude.  By sacrificing an amount of money that would not be a problem for them, they prevent millions of refugees from migrating to their country.  European countries talk about the sanctity of accepting refugees at all kinds of world meetings, but they themselves do not want to accept any refugees.  Some even say without hesitation, ""We should increase the aid provided to Turkey regarding refugee acceptance, so that they do not send refugees who have the potential to come to our countries.""
They are taking advantage of the power of their money..",2023-10-11 15:47:17

1469,1469.0,"From https://reddit.com/r/vancouver/s/UMZIzyMf41

Palestine has been genocidal towards the Jews for literally forever.  The state was founded on the idea of Jewish erasure and named Palestina as a reference to the Phillistines who invaded and enslaved the second Jewish commonwealth on the land.   This was done to remind the Jews of their place as slaves and lessen their attachment to their homeland.  There would literally be no Palestine without the theme of Jewish erasure or the fact that it was the Jewish homeland for many generations before Palestinians even existed.

Back in 1977 before the current narrative of infantilized Palestine was a thing the leader of the major ruling political party of Palestine the PLO, of which Fatah is a part, had this to say about what Palestine was.

“The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan. -Zuheir Mohsen, PLO leader

From: “Wij zijn alleen Palestijn om politieke reden,” James Dorsey, Trouw, 31 March 1977.

More honest times I suppose.  An era when social media could not be used to the advantages it is today.

This is why ironically Palestinians were only granted autonomy over their land once Israel was formed.  The Ottoman, British, Jordanian and Egyptians never allowed a formal Palestine state.

before Hamas existed modern Palestine has been calling for genocide and long before Israel existed they have been murdering Jews.

Riots in Jerusalem against Jews based on myths and antisemitism, like claims Jews drink the blood of children for Passover, have a long pedigree going back to 1847, 1870, and more. A massacre much like the one Hamas committed was done in 1929 in Hebron, resulting in the expulsion and wiping out of the entire Jewish community there, which had been there for thousands of years consistently.

“The riots took the form, for the most part, of attacks by Arabs on Jews accompanied by destruction of Jewish property. During the week of riots, from 23 to 29 August, 133 Jews were killed by Arabs, and 339 Jews were injured, most of whom were unarmed”

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots

This isn’t about Israel and the land it’s about religion and an obsession with Jewish extermination.

In the sayings of Muhammad in the Hadiths, Muhammad prophesy that End Times will only come when the Muslims have almost genocide the Jews into extinction:

""The last hour won't come before the Muslims would fight the Jews and the Muslims will kill them so Jews would hide behind rocks and trees. Then the rocks and tree would call: oh Muslim, oh servant of God! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. - Hadith narrated by Abi Hurira

The leader of Palestine didn’t hang out in the concentration camps and work with Hitler on his Final Solution because Israel existed.

Not Zionists, not Israel, not Orthodox Jews, not practicing Jews, all Jews, every one of them removed from the face of the earth. Palestine still calls for this to this day.

A quote from 2019. “Seven million Palestinians outside, enough warming up, you have Jews with you in every place. You should attack every Jew possible in all the world and kill them.”

And people will say that Hamas is not Palestine, and it’s true not everyone in Palestine supports Hamas, but the majority do.  Not just in Gaza but all of Palestine.

Despite people claiming that they are merely oppressed by a government they don't support, polls show that the most popular Palestinian presidential candidates are, in order:

• ⁠A man in Israeli prison for murdering multiple civilians in bombings during the Second Intifada, including arranging others who suicide bombed markets and buses. • ⁠Hamas leader. • ⁠Hamas leader.

And the Palestinian public, as polls have shown for at least a decade (and as shown by history stretching back to before Israel existed), is also broadly supportive of murdering Jewish civilians.

Today, polls show that a full 54% support, and only 41% oppose, ""armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel"". That means the average Palestinian supports precisely what Hamas did, massacring Jewish innocents, including men, women, children, and the elderly. Palestinians celebrated the attacks in the streets, and handed out sweets (just as they did after 9/11, for that matter). In Gaza specifically, which poses the thorniest problem, 67% of Palestinians support the armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel.

67%. 2 in 3 Gazans you meet will tell you openly they support the murder of innocent people.

Link to the most recent poll I could find from September 2023 where these stats come from.

https://pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Poll%2089%20English%20Full%20Text%20September%202023.pdf

This is why there is never peace.  Because Palestine will never accept it.  Every peace has been broken by Palestinian attacks and every attempt for two state resolution has been rejected or interrupted by rocket fire, assassination of Jewish politicians or terror attacks.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_peace_process

1471,1471.0,"They are in such vehement denial that Hamas and Arab anti-Semitic extremist organizations are the aggressors it blows my mind.

Palestinians claim they’ve always owned the land when in reality the Ottomans and then the British directly administered it, Jews and Palestinians had about the same amount of small patches of privately owned land scattered throughout the Ottoman/British-owned territory, then when Britain decided to pull out of Palestine in the late 40s they drew up a partition plan that took into consideration the Jewish and Palestinian populations who BOTH lived there for millennia.

The Arab world rejected the partitions then started 4 wars in which they got humiliated each time, and rightfully lost land they otherwise would’ve kept if they just played nice and recognized from the beginning that Jews have just as much of a valid claim to the land as Palestinians do.

I detest that Israel has stooped so low as to retaliate in kind to Hamas atrocities and aggressions, but what else are they supposed to do when Hamas is using innocent Palestinian civilians as human shields? The IDF at least has had the decency to warn Gazans of imminent attacks on these Hamas strongholds. The real question is why does Hamas base these strongholds in hospitals and schools?

Israel is facing extremist groups who believe there is a divine imperative to bring out the total destruction of Israel no matter the means. Read the Hamas charter for instance. Israel is locked in a fight for its very existence against groups who don’t play by any rules whatsoever and have shown with the October attack that they could care less about wasting innocent lives. They are facing groups that push upon the youth a distorted and bastardized version of history and a plethora of misinformation to try and radicalize them. Israel has been on the defensive since it’s conception.

Palestinian children in Gaza are being held hostage by their own government and Israel has every right to wipe Hamas out for good so that they can bring about a chance for Palestinians to self govern and have true stability and peace.",2023-10-12 04:27:39
1472,1472.0,"I am an American Jew ,who served in Israel IDF. and I will try to my best of my knowledge to explain to you ,how there’s no occupied land and how Israel has been extremely restrained in her actions for many years. 
I urge you to show this to the rest of the people who claim to be pro Palestine￼

1. When Germany lost portion of their land after WW1 , which the same happened to : Italy , Greece , Ottoman Empire , the British and more. 
None of them called out and said we want our land back that’s ours and called occupation! But Palestinian do!

Now let me remind you who lived In the area 400 and 500 years before Islam was even born! Cannan and Judea. Never palestine! In 135 CE, after stamping out the province of Judea’s second insurrection, the Romans renamed the province Syria Palaestina—that is, “Palestinian Syria.” They did so resentfully, as a punishment, to obliterate the link between the Jews and our land! 

But let’s fast forward and reach 1948 when the two state solution took place . Us Jews after the WW2 and the HOLOCAUST ,were more than happy with that because we get to live in a place we called home after being slaughtered for being Jewish. The arabs were not. They went to war against us with not 1 country behind them but 5 ! They’ve lost and we conquered that land! Now why is that okay for all the other countries throughout history to gain that control and why we don’t hear occupied territories?!  That wasn’t the only time that this took place . The same happen at 56,67,73,82 and into the 90’s and 2000’s . So after all these attempted not only we didn’t want that land we gave them some more so they can stop and try to attack us in between coffee breaks and night times.

2. Now that you understand that Israel not only won over 6 wars and  far more stronger. We have yet to destroy or harm them viciously like they have done on this past Saturday of October 7th. 
I have personally had kids shooting at me and the easiest thing to do is to eliminate that threat.  but instead we ducked down and waited for a 10 year old to finish his magazine. Same goes to kids coming to IDF posts in Israel border with explosive belt on them ( who the F does that and send kids to fight their wars and manipulate innocent lives) 

We have never killed kids or women the way they did this past Saturday! When we bomb a place that launched rockets into Israel we give them warning and tell them to vacate , but Hamas tells them not to leave and use them as human shield and keep firing rockets . so it’s either us or those  monsters that hide behind old people and kids. Mind you these people can escape which some do . But afterwards Hamas catch them and butcher them and their family Members. Just search that in Gaza and you’ll see. 

So now for the first time in many decades, Israel won’t hold back and it will release its full power. and whichever country who will come against us will get the same faith . So Iran , Yemen , Iraq bring it ! and we will be over a million strong and since we have no other country we will be more than willing to die defending ours. As for the Hamas and their other terrorist friends we will make sure you get to meet your 72 virgins. 

So before you pass judgment on Israel, imagine what would you do if your family and loved ones were targeted just for their religion and being and your sisters , daughters and mothers gotten raped in front of your eyes and you’ve being forced to watch cause you’re handcuffed and an AK47 to your head?! 
When less than that happened on Pearl Harbor and the Japanese attacked American soldiers and civilians and killed over 2,000 people. The USA launched an attack that shock the whole world and killed more than 200k people. 
80 years past by and no one question them nor have the balls to attack the USA as a country face on.

1477,1477.0,"The presence of Israel is just a small factor that the Arab Muslims can all agree they hate together. But in truth their #1 problem is Islam never underwent a reformation that could co-exist with Enlightenment and secular values. Whereas western societies are in a constant state of value introspection from decade to decade. And then this translates politically to non-Muslims not wanting to immigrate, invest, or start businesses in those societies, which just furthers the economic and idealogical divides between them and the west. 

The Muslims spent 800 years occupying and expanding into Europe and times were good for them. They were razing temples and synagogues and converting them into mosques. They built the Dome of the Rock over the Jewish Temple Mount to gloat over the victory and prevent the Jews from ever rebuilding the temple. Now that their religious values are incompatible with the modern world and the Jews are inflicting on them what they had been doing for nearly 1000 years, all they can do is rage at the west and make hypocritical demands of deference to their religion that they refuse to make for other religions. 

I pity them for not having exposure to an education that doesn’t brainwash and radicalize them, dooming them to repeat the cycle for the next generation.

The moment there is such a cultural pressure backed up by such a large mass of people (over a billion vs around 40 millions Jews globally) - you will alway see a huge representation of antisemitic views which will defuse into non-Muslim population due to mass regardless of the truth.

As I moved to other Arab nations, people swore as and spit at our feet when they heard we were just vacationing in Israel as well. My sister was harassed. We learned very quickly how intolerant Arab nations were. We constantly felt unsafe. I had to hold my sisters hand everywhere we went and guard her from aggressive men that would literally try and grope her off the streets.

When we were in Israel everyone was so positive and supportive. When we told them we were going to Egypt and Jordan next they gave us good information on things to do, places to see. They wished us well.

They gave us their contact info and said not to hesitate if we needed anything etc

Palestinians never wanted the jews to exist there. Ever since the early days where they legally co-habitated, Muslims just couldn't stand to live in a not fully Muslim state.

It has always been a sob story about ""they took our land"" not ""we want to live in a sharia state.   The British took the land. The Palestinians refused to participate in the democratic system that was put in place. The wealth and education disparity between European jews probably didn't help. 

When the Israelis finally gave Palestinians the pure Islamic states they begged for, they refused an offer to become their own independent nations. Instead, opting for being a walled territory with the hopes of conquering  the Israel some day.

The one-state solution left some gray zones, where Isaeli development in certain areas are TECHNICALLY legal, but make use of loopholes in laws. These are the settlements everyone whines about.


Most impactfully, the Palestinians use propaganda of being an oppressed underdog in an apartheid state (not reminding everyone it was the system THEY demanded.) In reality, they are constantly throwing themselves at Israel in such a way that they maximize the collateral of Israel's self defense actions. They sent kids in suicide vests so young boys are considered threats when they are sent to charge checkpoints. They fire rockets from the densest parts of their cities to instigate counter strikes, which invariably kill civillians. They charge and aggravate troops in threatening ways with the sole intention of getting killed to create an uproar.

I am hoping that what you mean here is that you dont understand why the Palestinian government won't accept the deals rather than you dont understand why people would still have an issue with decades of oppression of the Palestinian people. 


""All I see is Jewish hatred from the Palestinian people who elected Hamas knowing full well their intentions with Israel."" 

The average Palestinian age is 20 and half of them are children. The majority of people were not old enough to remember or even alive when Hamas was voted into power. They have known no life outside of occupation.

You are not looking very far if that is all you feel like you are seeing. I am seeing mountains of handwringing about whether or not the Israeli government has a right to wipe Palestinians off the map.


""I don’t see these putrid crimes of hatred committed by Hamas as justified. Comments like “the bully is getting bullied” and “they had it coming” are outright in support of Jewish death.""

I agree. I think the conversation about the place of armed resistance when combatting systematic oppression is a  valid one to have, but I dont think rape and torture fall under 'by any means necessary.' 

That does not in anyway take away from my support for the liberation of the Palestinian people.


""Announced attacks by Israel where civilians have enough time to leave cannot be compared to a surprise attack where hundreds of innocents were slaughtered, mutiliated, and paraded around Gaza like trophys."" 

Why do you so easily accept that Palestinians should just be fine giving up their homes to be bombed and where exactly do you think they can go to escape this violence, which is happening everywhere around them? Gaza is like 25 miles wide and they arent letting people in or out.

If you feel that way about the Hamas attack on Oct 7th, how do you feel about the death toll of Palestinian civilians over the past ten years that completely dwarves that of Israel? There is a complete asymmetry of violence enacted on the Palestinian people if you step outside of Oct 7th. Israel is poised to wipe the Palestinians off the map in the coming weeks. There is not now and has never been any comparable threat from Hamas to Isreali people. We cant equate oppression with resistance to oppression.


""You have Hamas bases underneath hospitals and city centers where they use the innocent Palestinian people as cannon fodder so they can plea to the rest of the world that the Israelis killed innocent Palestinians.""

I see the exact same thing from the Israeli government - using the Oct 7th attack to justify horrific violence on the Palestinian people. Both the Israeli government and Hamas are using civilians as pawns.

The Strip is surrounded by a 65-kilometer wall of concrete, steel, barbed wire, surveillance cameras and motion sensors. The wall height is from 7 to 9 meters, depending on the site. Every two kilometers – a machine-gun turret, which is controlled remotely. The wall patrols on land, water, and air and continues underground. There are only four passageways in the wall. Each has a checkpoint system with Gates, bars, barbed wire and machine gunners. Inside, on 365 square kilometers, 2.3 million people live.

Gaza has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt for 16 years.

The list of permitted / prohibited goods is constantly changing, and at various stages included imports of food, paper, pencils, soccer balls, musical instruments, books, candles, clothing, tableware, refrigerators, washing machines, glasses, light bulbs, matches, needles , blankets, shoes, mattresses, automobile parts and building materials (glass, concrete, iron, wood, paint, doors, pipes, generators, wires), fuel, fishing gear, hearing aids, wheelchairs. Without access to materials, it is impossible to restore Gaza's infrastructure. In particular, the water pump that provides the inhabitants of Gaza with water is clogged.

As a result of the blockade, hospitals in Gaza lack equipment and basic medicines, so patients have to seek help in Israel or the West Bank. To see a doctor, residents of Gaza have to ask Israel for permission to go outside the perimeter. Unauthorized access to the barrier – execution. Going to sea - execution. The airport was destroyed.

Most Gaza residents live below the poverty line and depend on the ability to leave the perimeter and work in Israel. To do this, they also need permission. The average salary in Gaza is $ 384/month. but over the past 6 years, it has fallen by 20%. The unemployment rate is 46.6%. Electricity is available from 4 to 13 hours a day, and depends entirely on the will of Israel. Now it doesn't exist at all. The only source of light is explosions. 35% of Gaza's agricultural land and 85% of its fishing areas are inaccessible to its inhabitants, as it is being shot through by Israel, which continues its expansion into Palestinian Territories. There are fewer and fewer of them. Regardless of their attitude towards Hamas, All Gaza residents depend on the organization for their daily needs. The majority of Gaza residents suffer from certain mental disorders: 93% have an anxiety disorder, 44% have severe chronic depression.

No, it's not a prison. This is a concentration camp. And then, suddenly, a rave takes place on its border, and everyone is now ""shocked"", they say, Where did these ""animals"" come from and attacked ""civilization"" - the disco of the ""beautiful and prosperous"" on the border with disaster. This catastrophe shocks the liberal inhabitants of the world for some reason less than the tearful faces of stoned majors who are carried away in the trunk by reality.

One issue is propaganda bots. A lot of hateful posts come from fake people. 

But, to the extent that this is a real problem, I believe the fundamental problem is that, because of a combination of personality disorders in some pro-Israel people and PTSD in Israelis, many visible pro-Israel people come off as legalistic, self-involved and rude. 

They write based on the perspective that all non-Jewish people and liberal Jewish people with even slightly critical views about Israel are unworthy of attention. 

One symptom: The people who come here, start posts with something like “Why do all Palestinians…?”, then give me 500 words about the Balfour declaration and what the PLO did in 1972. 

OK. I had tests on that in Hebrew school. I get where that’s coming from. It has nothing at all to do with how regular non-super-hawkish Israelis see Israel today. 

So, OK, most of those people aren’t calling for violence toward anyone. They don’t violate Reddiquette. But they aren’t thinking about how they’re coming off to non-Zionists. 

Then you have the stories about Jewish Israelis harassing the Bedouin or marching around Jerusalem and insulting anyone who looks Arab, and trashing Reform Jews. 

There are serious antisemites and other unfair people in the world who are going to hate Israel no matter what. 

But the kind of stuff I’m talking about gets people like me who grew waving Israeli flags and marching in pro-Israel flags horrified. 

It completely pushes our children away from Israel.

So, then the horrific news of the Hamas attack shows up, and Israel’s international relations outreach has been so poor that I start to oay attention to the speculation that Netanyahu and Ben Gvir let this happen to justify flattening Gaza.

1553,1553.0,"Reducing the issue to anti-semitism reduces the conflict to a simplistic narrative that isn’t derived from fact or the history.

The basic reason you are seeing Israeli hate is because Zionism has always been an expansionary settler movement, that created anxiety in the local Palestinian population since the late 1800’s. It’s not hard to see a correlation between what you percieve as anti-semitism in the region with the violent creation of the Israeli state. This is something that was actually predicted by early zionist leaders:

Ben-Gurion said in 1918: ""We as a nation want this country to be ours; the Arabs, as a nation, want this country to be theirs"". Resistance was to be expected. Jabotinsky said in 1921: ""I don't know of a single example in history where a country was colonised with the courteous consent of the population"" And ""Every indigenous people will resist alien settlers as long as they see any hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement. This is how the Arabs will behave and go on behaving so long as they possess a gleam of hope that they can prevent Palestine from becoming the Land of Israel.""

The entire reason Israel is considered an Apartheid state is derived from the Zionist aims to subjugate the Palestinians and remain the absolute demographic majority in order to maintain the idea of Israel being a Jewish homeland. This is repeatedly cited in reports from B’Tselim, Amnesty, Human Rights Watch & Numerous UN special Raperteurs, among other parties, who have published similar legal findings of Apartheid in Israel. 

So what is the problem with Israel existing? It‘s the fact that the Palestinians have no political recourse to protect their right to self-determination in their land, which has been historically eaten up, divided and provoked mass exodus of Palestinians from their home. At the same time, a Jew living in long Island has the ability to call Israel his home, where many Palestinians who have lived in Palestinian for generations are rejected from returning to their homes. Further fuel is thrown into the fire by the constant control of Palestinian lives and the illegal disposetion of their homes so that a foreign Jew from another part of the world can claim at as their rightful home. 

All the above, and more, is the problem with “Israel just existing”. Does anti-semitism exist in Palestine? For sure there is some. Is it the reason for all the issues you’ve been seeing lately? Definitely not. Does anti-Palesitinism exist in Palestine? Its hard to argue otherwise, given how institutional, ideological, systemic and long-lasting the occupation has been. 

I have friends from both ends of the aisle, and what is clear to me is that in the end of the day, it is a land dispute between an occupied people and colonizers, both of whom are indigenous to the land. All these side discussions from both sides relating to hate (ethnic, religous and otherwise) and security only stem from the root cause of occupation. Both parties deserve to live in peace and dignity, but concessions need to be made by both sides. 

Palestine need to elect moderate leaders who are not self-serving, and recognize Israel is here to stay. Israel need to recognize Palestinian rights, dismantle their occupation/Apartheid and re-align their goals from short/medium term success of establishing complete control of Palestine and instead focus on long-term goals of establishing organic peace as opposed to following extremist ideological goals.",2023-10-12 06:31:42

Take it from somebody who has spent over a decade arguing with these people online and in person, there is a substantial population of leftists, particularly younger ones, who refuse to break any of the following rules:

**A:** In any conflict, the side with darker skin is the good guys.

**B:** The side with less hard power is always righteous. Palestine has taken more casualties over the past decades, and they have less tech, so they must be the good guys. Things like combat vs civilians deaths, or Gaza using human shields, or preventative deaths, are completely irrelevent in their eyes (assuming they can understand these concepts to begin with).

**C:** Colonialism is bad. The fact that palestinians are no more ""native"" to the area than israeli's are is something they can't comprehend because in their mind the middle east belongs to arab people. I'm not exaggerating when I say most of these people who rant about colonialism think history played out like this:>Humans of different races were placed in their respective continents and everyone lived peacefully within respected borders.>People within their ethnicity always got along and never fought each other.>White people invented gunpowder and went around colonizing and messing everything up because they're mean.

You think Hamas attacked Israel because Jews live there? Trust me, it wouldn’t matter if they were English or Dutch Protestants. Wouldn’t matter if they were Godless Chinese atheists. Wouldn’t matter if they were green aliens. Israel has perpetrated a decades-long, brutal military occupation of Palestinian territories, inside the ‘67 borders, in violation of international law, condemned by the World Court, slicing up the West Bank into disconnected communities with illegal settlements and turning Gaza into a Concentration Camp. 

All of it bought and paid for with US tax dollars, and there is absolutely *nothing* the international community can do diplomatically to stand up against the world’s sole superpower. Look at the record of US vetoes in the Security Council as they relate to Israel/Palestine. There will be no diplomatic solution as long as the US keeps blocking it and sending Israel *huge* amounts of military aid, far more than it does to any other country. The balance of power is overwhelmingly in Israel’s favor, hence, if you look at the casualties, they are overwhelmingly Palestinian. 

This has nothing to do with antisemitism, which is much more prevalent and pernicious in Europe and the United States, and everything to do with an illegal, brutal occupation intended to bring about the slow erasure of the Palestinian people and state. Which will now accelerate exponentially. 

If you really want to go down the religious rabbit-hole, try this: as European Jews were becoming the slow victims of their own hideous destruction and erasure of their communities and culture during the Holocaust (worst moral crime in history? Absolutely!) would you have accorded them the rights to stand up against their imprisonment and murder by their oppressors with violence, if necessary, even though it wasn’t even an option for most Jews, save for those very few who tried to resist? **OF COURSE YOU WOULD!!**

If the horrors of Treblinka, Dachau, Majdanek, Sobibor, Auschwitz, etc,  could have been subverted by armed resistance leading to German & Polish casualties, would you have supported it? **OF COURSE!!** 

But nobody, absolutely nobody, cared about the fate of the people in those prisons at the time, *certainly* not the United States. And that’s the lesson. They said never forget, right? **So don’t!** Don’t forget about people who are being stepped on and extinguished with your tax money. 

Hamas’ tactics will not succeed. But you need to recognize that there are no other tactics when this occupation is supported consistently by the most powerful nation in history and its media, who are currently doing everything they can to make sure Americans have *only one* narrative to follow here. 

You won’t hear about how these people are imprisoned by land, air, & sea, and have been for decades, cut off from the West Bank as it becomes subsumed into Israel, watching the slow erasure of what remains of Palestine. You won’t hear about what life is like in the occupied territories.

Palestine had been living there for generations, practicing religion on this sacred ground, and then out of nowhere the city council comes in and says we're taking half your land and giving it to a group of people that practice a different religion than you. They also will end up having dramatically more money than you, completely control your water and power, show you nothing but disrespect and abuse for decades.

Time goes on, and new children born under this regime know nothing but oppression and hate. For years, and years, you beg, but it is net only with silence, further oppression, and them taking your land.

Now, you see these people as almost non - human, because they treated you as a non human for so long. It is easy to kidnap, kill, destroy when you live in a mindset that there is literally no other way to save your family. 

To me, those who are Pro Israel mainly seem to be following the rhetoric that Hamas randomly murdered innocent people, completely out of nowhere. This is not the case.

Referring to the Israeli occupation of Palestine as a “conflict” or the Israeli attacks as part of a “war” incorrectly serves to create a false equivalence between the two parties, as if they were equal and balanced.

Israel is an independent nation that invests USD 20 billion per year in military and intelligence forces, which are among the most sophisticated in the world. It controls the borders, skies, sea coasts, telecommunications and economy of Palestine, whose government has extremely limited autonomy. Palestinian armed resistance for years has included knives, fireworks, homemade explosives and paragliders as an essential part of its arsenal. The Palestinians have no tanks, planes, warships, submarines or heavy artillery. In recent years, they have received more foreign military aid — still paltry compared to the might of the Israeli military.

Israel is not at “war” or “conflict” with Hamas or the nation of Palestine — it is an illegal colonial occupation force that uses its powerful army to, on a daily basis, commit crimes against humanity to repress the Palestinians, a people who is resisting their racist colonization.",2023-10-12 05:24:56

1609,1609.0,"It not that complicated.  In 1897 the idea of Zionism started about re-establishing a Jewish State in the Middle East.   The Ottoman Empire had ruled the area of hundreds of years.  It was the largest Muslim empire in the world.   The Ottoman Empire took the side of Germany in WWI.   

While WWI was ongoing the British government floated the idea of a Jewish State thru a document called the Balfour Document in 1917.   During WWI the British government wanted to enlist Jewish support in the War.  Jewish populations largely supported Germany prior to the declaration.    World War I ends and the Ottman's and Germany has lost.   What to do?

Following the Armistice of Mudros, most Ottoman territories were divided between Britain, France, Greece and Russia. The Ottoman Empire officially ended in **1922** when the title of Ottoman Sultan was eliminated.   Turkey became a country in 1923. 

The are of Palestine falls under control of the British Government through Mandate for Palestine passed by the league of nations.   It called for the establishment of a two nation state.   The one key issue is there is already somebody living in the territory the Palestinian popolation.

During the 1930's the British allowed and did a whole lot of bad things to the native population of the time to allow for the rise of Jewish control.    WWII happens and the holocaust.   Many jews fled Europe and went to the middle east before and during the war.    

The UN is formed post WWII.    A resolution is passed 181 that calls for the establishment of a Jewish state and a Palestinian state.   The problem is this resolution was rather one sided gave more land and better land to the Jewish state when the population of the area was largely non-jewish.    Worse, the agreement did not receive support from the local countries (the Arab League) and the local population was against it.    The Mandate expires and the British pull out.

A civil war occurs.   The Jewish population is armed by Britain, the United State and even Stalin through Czechoslovakia.   The Jewish declare a state in 1948 and immediately go to war with its neighbors and they win.   The result is 700,000 non-Jewish citizens are thrown off their land to allow for the formation of the Jewish State.   The United States is responsible for getting the UN vote passed.   It was done becuase of domestic concerns with Jewish voters, outstanding Jewish lobbying and threats of the US on smaller nations and even bribes.   The Key is none of the arab states supported it.   

So basically we have hundreds of thousands of folks thrown off their land.   Kept in refugee camps since the 1950's.   Both Israel and the Arab world largely ignored the refugee issue and folks have lived in poverty and despair since.   This breads hatred.   Israel took the land, held the land and fought its neighbors and won over three wars.   The US props up Israel as well.   So basically western powers created a deal.  It wasn't accepted locally.   Israel won.  

Even Iran and Israel were allies when the US propped up the Shah of Iran for years.   The islamic revolution caused the overthrow of the regime in 1979 and Iran became and enemy of Israel and the US because in their opinion the west is deciding the fate of the region.

Some Arab states have tried to move past and have normalized relations with Israel.   Some folks will not forget or forgive Israel for taking their land and its still recent enough where folks are still allive.",2023-10-11 18:42:48

1620,1620.0,"The Israeli state was formed 1948, meant to give Jews fleeing persecution in Europe their own state. it was meant to give Jewish people their own state. The unfortunate truth is that, foreign powers gave the Israeli state land that already belonged to Palestinians. Palestinians aren't exclusively Muslim. Back then it was Muslims, Jews, and Christians. The issue has been that once the State of Israel was formed, and backed by western powers, they began expanding voraciously claiming lands that were Palestinian as their own, and driving the indigenous people off of their land.   


This has been a long developing situation longer than the past 5 days. The Palestinian people have been suffering at the hands of the Israeli State for the past 75 years. in 2018 they protest peacefully every friday for almost 18 months. And the Israeli army massacred roughly 2-300 peaceful protesters. Hamas always believed in armed resistance to the Israeli state. The issue is called complex because of how much back and forth over the past 75 years, but it is simple. This situation started when land was illegally annexed by Israeli State.    


Since then Israeli State, has killed far more Palestinians, and has been backed by the US the entire time. Warcrimes committed by the Israeli State have been overlooked for reasons unbeknownst to me, and western powers have been turning a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis, afraid to blame the Israeli State. My guess is the fear of being called anti-semitic. The funding of the US has been extremely crucial in Israel Defense Forces ability to ""protect"" their lands from Hamas. So when people are saying Free Palestine, it is not meant to be a death to all jews, or kill all israelis. People are just asking that international law holds the Israel  State Accountable for its 7 decades of humans rights violations.   


Israeli officials are on record dehumanizing Palestinians, and have essentially told the world they are planning on committing more War Crimes in order to snuff out the remainder of Hamas. The israeli state is okay with killing Palestinian Civilians.   


I encourage you to do your own research from a variety of news sources. And read everything on reddit/socials with a grain of salt. and remember, that the Israeli State must take the blame in entirety. Not the innocent Israelis or Palestinians who have been losing their lives as collateral damage.

And I'm saying this as a polish person, my family was a victim of nazi terror long time ago as well.  


This conflict was there of decades, Jewish soldiers from Israel were VERY brutal last few years. Human Rights Watch even confirmed this: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children)  


I'm very oppose to war, every polish person is, that's why in Westerplatte in Poland (place where german nazi soldiers attacked Poland 01/09/1939) we have a sign that says ""NIGDY WIECEJ WOJNY"" (War never again), but... well, I'm not surprised. The Palestinian Street want's Hamas, because they want their own country, their own freedom and that their people will be safe even if they are living next to the Jewish border posts. And Hamas promised them that.   


After the 1WW and the second world war many of the Jews came to Palestine, then united nations divided the Palestine into Jewish and Arab part, the Palestinians did not like it at all. Read about Nakba, the mass depopulation of palestinian villages in 1948, basically 80% of arab population had to leave their homes.   


Israel never went for any sort of agreement, never.   


I'm against of what is going right now, but I know why it is happening. And believe me, noone wants war.

I think most muslim government would disagree with this attack as it is against Islamic principles in theory, but they would have to nuance it because they do not support Israel's treatment of palestinians, and might be scared that condemning publicly and strongly Hamas could just be as agreeing with Israel's use of full force in Gaza.

“I intervened to shut down antisemitic chants from a group of idiots who were in the minority,” he posted on Twitter. “Police told me to my face that they would not assist.”

Ali said the behaviour of that minority was “not only vulgar but completely selfish”.

“It has served as a distraction from the immense human suffering in Gaza and calls for genocide and collective punishment by Israeli officials.”

Fellow organiser Amal Naser said the young men taking part in the antisemitic chants were not part of the main group and had joined at the Opera House.

She tried to get police to move them on but “they put the onus on us to disperse them”.

“The police are there to help us create a peaceful rally and to help us coordinate [but] we were asked to disburse them ourselves, which is absolutely ridiculous,” she said.

She added: **“We absolutely condemn any form of antisemitism and it’s not associated to our movement. Our movement is an anti-racist and anti-colonial movement.”**'

3.The lighting of the Opera House sails in the ISRAELI FLAG cost the people of NSW $100000.

4.Australians generally tolerate each other and live peacefully together. This violence is UNUSUAL in my Country and has stemmed from the hatred between HAMAS and the IDA

2029,2029.0,"Breaking it down to antisemitism is a big mistake. When Mandela fought for the indepence of his people, he did not do it because he hated white people. He hated that strangers killed, raped, beat and dislocated civilians in their own country. It could have been anybody. 
But what happends, after generation of suffering, is the rise of a certain mentality.
Antisemitism is surely of a twisted mentality among some people of palestine. But it cannot be compared to the antisemitism in Europe or America or elsewhere.
If Israelis where Christians, than their hate would be towards Christians, if they where blue, three eyed humanoids, than that would be their enemy.
People who don't live in Palestine and just blatantly support antisemitic narratives are as stupid as the ones who don't understand why some Palestinians hate Israelis.
Palestinians like any other Arab community are humans and humans can only endure so much before breaking. I am not in support of any side. But if I was held hostage in my own country and had to witness how people get bombed, humiliated, killed, raped and stripped from everything they have, I would be filled with hate too. The West is responsible for the suffering in the middle east, not only in Palestine. It has planted its seeds of evil everywhere around the world and puts the blame on others when it carries fruits.
The West has never shown sympathy for other cultures, like real, good hearted sympathy. Why should the victims care? Why should these people, who's only crime is being born in a man made shithole, feel sorry for anyone.
You should not start with the numbers game because it is not in favor of Israel. They have killed so many people that basically every palastinian has at least one family member murdered by the IDF or illegal settlers.
You should watch some footage of IDF soldiers proudly confirming the rape, murder and dislocation of civilians.
I have heard from many members of the Jewish community that they would push the button if that means for all Arabs to just drop dead.

In 1917, the Ottoman Empire fell . During this England acquired what is present day Israel and the land that is currently being fought over.

They want to conquer and control and believe in ethnic cleansing this are not good people or people any of you support. Please keep this in mind. 

ENGLAND OCCUPIED THIS LAND from 1922-1949. England controlled it ran it and collected resources from it. It was theirs. 

England did shady things but long story short, they tried to pull a USA and try to be involved without being involved. They didn’t want to outwardly give the land to Israel so they essentially held it until Israel established themselves and when they established themselves England goes

You conveniently ignore what peace proposals Arabs are officially sticking to (like the [Arab Peace initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Peace_Initiative) which I touched on in a [response to a very similar comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/13z68bl/comment/jmq0zn7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I suspect you took and just added stuff near the end to), Zionist rejections of peace plans as well as context to say the peel commission which included Britain gaining a permanent Mandate over the Jerusalem area and ""corridor"" stretching to the Mediterranean coast at Jaffa—and the land under its authority, as well as Jews/Zionists being iffy about it. But since you find it convenient to mention Hamas' actions, and not exclusively peace proposals, why start at 1937 and cherry-pick misleading information where you make it seem like Palestinians were only rejecting peace proposals and were only engaged in terrorism? You don't even try to cover pretty much any of the history of Zionism, Arab/Palestinian nationalism, the Mandate, Zionist terrorist organizations, everything in Lebanon, the settlements (except in passing) etc. I'm gonna pick a random peace offer you mentioned:

>2008: Israel offers Mahmoud Abbas once again recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital and even offered to dismantle all their settlements. And once again, the Palestinians reject it.

East Jerusalem was not offered as it's capital. The most they were actually told to get:

""According to one of the documents, the Palestinian Authority was prepared to concede most Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, as well as the Armenian Quarter, with the exception of Har Homa. The Temple Mount would be temporarily administrated by a joint body consisting of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States until a permanent solution was reached.\[23\]""

(from Palestine Papers article linked below)

And the Times of Israel said that Olmert ""proposed that the “Holy Basin” be overseen instead by a five-member, non-sovereign international trusteeship, comprising Israel, the PA, Jordan, the US and Saudi Arabia."" (article linked below).

More information:

""According to Al Jazeera, Abbas was not allowed to keep the unofficial map, so he sketched it by hand. During the first of several meetings, the Palestinian Authority proposed a land swap, offering Israel the opportunity to annex all of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem in return for land concessions by Israel. Olmert, however, offered no concessions in return but an even more aggressive land swap.\[24\]

In Prime Minister Olmert's own proposal, Israel would annex 6.3% \[25\] of the West Bank. The land in Olmert's map included the four settlements of Gush Etzion (with Efrat), Ma'ale Adumim, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ariel, in addition to all settlements in East Jerusalem (Har Homa). In exchange for those concessions by the Palestinian Authority, Olmert offered 5.8% \[25\] of Israeli land as part of the swap. The land offered consisted of lightly populated farmland, which would be divided between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused. Mahmoud Abbas sketched Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration.\[26\] This map was then later referred to as the Napkin map.\[24\]

The third and final meeting occurred on 16 September 2008. It was during this time that Ehud Olmert was nearing the end of his political career. At the time, Olmert was under police investigation for alleged corruption that had occurred while he was Mayor of Jerusalem, and as a result of the accusations was not planning on running again. During the final meeting, Mahmoud Abbas was prepared by the Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) to clarify many questions regarding Ehud Olmert's peace plan in which Abbas was quoted as asking questions such as ""How do you see it addressing our interests, especially as Ariel, Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Homa and Efrat clearly prejudice contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine?"" as well as others about the value of the land that they would receive in such a swap in terms of value and size.\[24\]

The Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) also insisted that Prime Minister Olmert provide them with a copy of the map, which was again denied. In the end, however, Mahmoud Abbas asked for a few days to consider the offer. A day after this meeting, Olmert resigned and Tzipi Livni stepped in as Acting Prime Minister, with Benjamin Netanyahu being elected shortly afterward. Palestinian negotiators said Abbas had forgotten another appointment and postponed the next meeting. Netanyahu thought Olmert had made too many concessions and refused to continue from where the last round of negotiations had left off, preferring to restart the negotiations from the beginning.""

The League of Nations passed the Mandate for Palestine which saw Britain overseeing the territory of Palastine and TransJordan.   The initial proposal under UN resolution 181 saw 62% of the Land go to the formation of Israel while the population of Palestinians was double the population of Jewish Settlers.   It took extensive Jewish Lobbying and Extenstive Pressure by Truman and the United States to get member countries to vote for the resolution.   Yes the resolution was voted against by the Arab League and the Arab World.    The plan was biased against the Arab World.  A civil war broke out which resulted in a large number of Palestinians fleeing the territories that would become Israel.

UN Resolution 194 also grants the rights of the Palestinians the right to re-occupy lands taken during the Mandate and successive wars.

Have you ever seen the way arab women dress in Lebanon, at parties in Dubai and elsewhere?

Walking near naked in the streets is frowned upon, but jeans and t shirt is perfectly fine. I used to wear miniskirts in Amman in the eighties. People stared, some whistled but all in good humor.

Lgbt don’t have full rights in the US, maybe in big cities but in many areas it is not safe to admit you are gay. 

Women still don‘t have full equal legal rights in most of the world. India, Africa even Russia.

At the same time, a lot of younger American Jews genuinely have a very flawed understanding of the conflict, and that can turn into a sort of ""both-sides-ism"" that's very frustrating for the folks you encounter that disagree with you, even if they're willing to acknowledge the faults that their side has had, and their shared humanity with ""the other side"".

Framing the conflict as, ""both sides are equally wrong,"" is unlikely to be true, and *is* guaranteed to upset whoever you're talking to, regardless of which ""side"" they are on. It's also not really accurate.

e.g., take a single phrase you used as an example: ""the siege of Gaza"". 

The Great Wall of China wasn't built to ""besiege"" the Eurasian steppe; it was a defensive fortification. Similarly, Gaza has not been ""under siege""; the two countries it borders have closed their borders and territorial waters to it. As with all militarized borders, that was in *response* to continued aggression (from Gaza, into Egypt and into Israel). Both countries experienced dozens of bombings and terrorist attacks a year ... so they shut down their borders, and did their best to not allow armaments to get through to the other side, knowing that the armaments would be used *against them.* 

The 'siege' framing implies that Israel and Egypt are doing this in order to force Gaza into submission; it's literally Hamas's framing of the situation, because when people think of ""siege"", they think of starving a garrison until they surrender. Israel doesn't *want* Gaza to surrender. It doesn't *want* to occupy Gaza; it already occupied it for 38 years, and it *left.* It just wants Gaza to *stop attacking Israel.* The agency is with Hamas; Israel can't do anything to end the situation, but Hamas can. 

So ... it's not a siege.",2023-10-11 12:02:09

And suppose there was a mantra associated with this burgeoning movement that acknowledged the simple and overdie truth that Black Lives Matter.  Suppose also that some of the riots turned violent at times, some opportunistic looting and vandalism occurred, and worst of all, some acts of direct violence including murder targeting individual police occurred. Now imagine you were in a room of black Americans during this tumultuous time of emotions running high and a revolution in racial conversation in this country, and someone with a love of all humanity just like yours  said, right in front of you ""I know this shouldn't be controversial so I'm just going to say it. ALL LIVES MATTER. Systemic racism in the policing of black communities and individuals must be condemned, and so must acts of violence by black men against police.

People scoffed at this notion before as Israel was actually the one on the defense hunkering down behind fences and the Iron Dome, while the entire time Hamas was extremely efficient at importing significant weaponry, ammunition and training in order to inflict mass casualties on Israel.  

It's now entirely clear that once Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, the die was cast.  Sadly, Israel waited too long and allowed the entire institutional capture of an area the size of Philadelphia with over 2 million people to become a forward operation base for Iranian ambitions in the region.

Almost all of them have called for peace and acknowledged the sad loss of life and suffering that Palestinians experience as well - both in person and on social media. The vast majority of Jewish people DO NOT WANT WAR. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron. Jewish people have suffered at the hands of subsequent governments and empires for generations. The city I was born in was the site of a massacre of Jewish children where the Nazi army lined up dozens of Jewish children and shot them 1 by 1 into a mass grave because they were CRYING TOO LOUD. On account of all their parents already having been shot dead and them being left starving and cold in a building. That same town that once had a bustling Jewish population of over 50% today has less than 0.1%

Israel in many respects has become the final stand for Jewish people. It’s where people fled to and said enough is enough. We deserve dignity and safety too. Out of that they’ve built one of the most beautiful and thriving countries in the world and it’s the only state the Jewish people have. Literally the only one. 

All throughout its existence, it’s Israel extending the olive branch asking its Arab neighbours to recognise its existence, accept it and let them live in peace. Every time it has been Israel and the Jewish people offering compromises to come to a solution. And every time their hand has been slapped away and been rewarded with war and terrorism instead.

So to answer your question. Are you weird for considering and mourning Palestinian lives? No you’re not, this is a normal Jewish response as all life is sacred and we all know war begets war.

Even now I’ve noticed if you criticize the USA in general (such as kneeling for the flag instead of standing for it in protest of something), people will claim that you’re disrespecting the soldiers who died fighting for the US.

With the settlers never moving out and more influx of Jews into Gaza and West Bank there was never a chance of Palestinians feeling legitimized if the Israelites still live in their territory that was sanctioned to them by UN agreements.

Regrettably, the residents of Gaza fell under Hamas's influence, undergoing a form of brainwashing, and through history have consistently rebuffed Israel's efforts to cooperate. Israel did all it could, even closing borders to prevent violence spilling over. Substantial funds were sent to aid the Gaza Strip's people. Yet, Hamas seized these resources, including water pipes, converting them into rockets. These funds failed to enhance their living conditions, infrastructure, or education; instead, they enriched Hamas leaders. If Palestinians were to establish their own government and become self-reliant, Hamas would lose its financial incentives so Hamas has no motivation to improve their lives. The true victims in this situation are the women and young children, as their men, who are meant to protect them, too often permit them to suffer as casualties of war.

There is nothing wrong about you feeling sorry for the innocent Palestinians getting hurt in the crossfire I have sympathy for them too. However, there is no moral equivalence in this fight. If Israel laid their weapons down for 1 minute there would be no Israel left. The Palestinians in Gaza under Hamas leadership have rejected over 5 different piece agreements over the years that would have dramatically improved the life of the Palestinians. 

Most people forget that Israel removed thousands of their own citizens in 2005 and gave it to the Palestinians as a gesture of piece to live and create opportunity for themselves.

The international community has poured in billions of dollars in foreign aid over the years and what did they do with those funds? They didn’t invest it in building up Gaza to help their people rather to purchase weapons, rockets, bombs, tunnels, to launch attacks against Israel. Hamas has held power in Gaza for 16 years and what did they do with that power? The lives of the Palestinians have only gotten worse and less safe because  their primary goal is not to improve Palestinian lives in the region but to destroy Israel. 

There are over 1.6 million Palestinians that live under Israeli territory. They walk around freely, have rights can participate in the economy etc.. I’m pretty sure they would not trade places to be governed by Hamas. 

The unfortunate reality is that it is Hamas that has no regard for the Palestinians hiding behind them placing weapons in schools, mosques, In civilian populations hiding behind their own people like cowards while they bring upon this hell and destruction on gaza but then cry’s victim to gain sympathy from the world. it is Hamas to blame for the pain and suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza and need to be eliminated before piece can be achieved.",2023-10-12 03:52:52

I don't know the numbers but I'm willing to bet that  Hamas has committed far more war crimes than Israel (they often fire rockets deliberately at civilians for instance). But even if you assume that the numbers are balanced Israel does mostly when they respond to Palestinian attacks. Then there's the institutional response of both sides to their combatants committing war crimes. In Israel at worst, these things are controversial with some hardliners supporting them and the majority condemning them. Baruch Goldstein was not a soldier but it's an example I can give off the top of my head: his actions were publicly condemned by the Israeli government who proscribed their organization and took away the rifles of their Kibbutz. The Palestinian government and people on the other hand celebrate these actions widely. That's why I have a big problem with the centrist view of ""both sides bad"".

EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD BE PLACING THE VALUE OF LOVE AND RESPECT FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEING ABOVE ANY OTHER VALUE - INCLUDING GOD/RELIGION, ETHNICITY, GOVERNANCE STYLE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

If people could just do that en masse, problem solved. But people can’t do that because people are ultimately too narrow minded to handle this simple concept. People can still value their gods and ethnicities but those values must come below the top value bolded above.

Regarding governance/financial - it really should be minimalist free market capitalism with a robust supportive charity system and values toward charity/love of our fellow human beings across the globe. There will be some controversial elements to all this but my bolded paragraph remains the same.

Once this basic value structure actually changes en masse, war and hate ends.

Israeli agencies (known for superior intelligence in arab-israel war and up until now) let this happen and organizes it even. General public only gets to know what is shown. Palestinians control such a small space with such tight perimeter around them, there is no way they cannot see paraglides/technicals and all sorts of things piling up. You can easily find people motivated to do this in Palestine which see terror and voilance by Israel on a daily basis. If you had your family member shot in the face on monday and someone comes the next day, here is a opportunity for you then 10/10 they will take it. 

Now Israel will take and have full advantage to attack in anyway they want. We can only imagine what horror and terror they will show. US suddenly approving 4.5 billion aid to an already sophisticated army against who? Basic militia, just now in another sub people making fun of tractors crossing in and shot by gunboat.

People, it is not about taking sides but about reading news and using your intellect to know what is really going on. And calm your hatred and biases when analyzing the situation. 

People! condemn what is wrong and understand who is behind and who gets the ultimate advantage. 

Israel wants to make their 3rd temple ultimately, this gives them all go ahead to first unleash bombing in that area and say oh no collateral as you guys attacked us on Sabbath. Any religion you follow or are atheist, remember the benefactor and war is engaged by people who are strong.

There was no way Hamas was going to conquer entire Israel and if they even take a village it will be cleared by like local police. 

Be wise, and remember be knowledgeable before you propagate and approve further war. Understand your biases and hatred within you and say the truth even if it goes against you. 

Israel has total right for just and reciprocal response but nothing more otherwise it will be like Big school bully punching in his own face to like decimate you and achive whatever intentions he has.",2023-10-07 13:05:46

For years many Americans and I had concerns about the use of force by Israelis.  We believed Palestinians needed freedom, that they were being oppressed unjustly.

Then, in the span of a weekend that all changed.  It became obvious very quickly that the majority of Palestinians support Hamas and support terrorism.  They support the murder of children just as a way to hurt Israel.

All these feelings we had for Palestinians, it's out the window now.  

The realities of the situation are:

1. Hamas is the official government of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

2. Being as Hamas is the official government of Gaza, their attack on Israel was a declaration of war.

3. There will be no further sympathy, Hamas has made us choose between the genocide of Israelis and the genocide of Palestinians, we obviously will side with Israel.

They f'd around and found out, I don't care if people say ""Hamas doesn't care about the Palestinians"", somebody should tell the Palestinians that.  Because at this point I don't f'ing care about Palestinians either.  I did, but the actions of the Palestinian government changed that.",2023-10-10 15:12:39

Not a lot of people in the west understand this however. War crimes abd terrorism are just that, call a spade a spade. Idf and Hamas are guilty of both at times, and it's irrelevant to look at who killed more or who started it when you're talking about real lives and trauma. It feels like the free Palestine movement will take a big knock from this, nobody wants to associate with the idiots celebrating rape and beheading even if we know that's a small minority, many of whom aren't even from Palestine, and many of the victims weren't even Jewish or Israeli let alone supporters of Zionism. 

To me, being pro Palestine also means being pro Israel - and by that, I mean wanting freedom for both sides. Liberal, moderate and open Israelis are also victims of their government as well as any action by Palestine (whether retaliatory or not.) Jews the world over are forced to answer and give their opinions on israel and fall further victim to hatred and xenophobia. The millions upon millions of Muslims who condemn terrorist acts will further be thrown under the bus. There needs to be open discussion on how you can be pro palestinian freedom while admitting that means freeing them both from occupation by Israel AND by terrorist parties like Hamas. I still support the people of Palestine but this has just made me even more vocal about the nuances of it, and how support doesn't mean you support all actions blindly. I have Israeli friends, some of whom had friends at that party. They were by and large very liberal, anti occupation and pro palestinian but now joining the idf to defend. So well done Hamas, for radicalising the people who wanted your land to be free. If it's done that to liberals who tried to evade conscription, just imagine how excited the Zionists are to gun the west bank down.

Bibi is an idiot and he's done a bunch of bad things that directly come into the current situation

* fighting with the security services which definitely could have lead to the current intelligence failure
* the border appears to have been completely devoid of defenses with only a few hundred soldiers because he sent the rest to protect settlements
* targeting the university in Gaza for destruction rather than capture and other recent targeting decisions which look escalatory
* his long term strategy of pushing down the PLO by working more with their more fanatical buddies

I believe it will turn out that Bibi was at least negligent and is now, knowingly, going beyond what most Israelis would want if they could get to a moment of peaceful reflection (maybe twenty years from now). Bibi is elected but that doesn't mean all Israelis are responsible for his actions. Israelis have a right to self defense, even if Bibi somehow broke the law to make them use it. *Just as not all Palestinians are Hamas, not all Israelis are their government.*

A very specific thing is that [Bibi's settler friends are apparently already taking advantage of the situation](https://archive.ph/9jEbX). The secular Israelis like those at a dance festival or in the Kibbutzes suffer because Hamas specifically targets them whilst the fanatics are profiting. That's not an accident - the fanatics everywhere see their common cause against decent moderation.

A question I'd ask you is ""will you condemn Netanyahu now?"". I'm not even going to ask you to do that because, it's directly a time of war and he's the war leader. You personally might be able to but lots of other Israelis would feel that it's the wrong time. Justice and condemnation can wait till people are actually safe.

That means that, for the future, its absolutely crucial that everyone recognizes the separation between civilians and government. Between criminals and those that live next to them.

14% said the establishment of the PA in the mid-nineties, and 9% said it was the establishment of Fateh in the sixties and the launch of the armed struggle.

...

If new presidential elections were held today and only two were nominated, Mahmoud Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh [the leader of Hamas], only 46% would participate and from among those, Abbas would receive 33% and Haniyeh 56% of the votes (compared to 52% for Haniyeh and 36% for Abbas three months ago). In the Gaza Strip, Abbas receives 30% of the votes and Haniyeh receives 65%. In the West Bank, Abbas receives 37% and Haniyeh 47%.

...

In an open-ended question, where no names were provided to respondents, we asked the public to 
select a successor to president Abbas. The largest percentage (27%) selected Marwan Barghouti [a leader in the 1st and 2nd Intifadas], 16% went to Haniyyeh, followed by Shtayyeh and Mohammad Dahlan (4% each), Khalid Mishal and Yahya al Sinwar (3% each), Hussein al Shaykh (2%), and 1% selected Mustafa Barghouti.""

For me these hours when she was there were hell, I understood she’s in danger around 8:30 we talked on the phone while she was sitting in the car escaping. Later she asked not to call again but only text her. She told me she is surrounded by terrorists and I couldn’t believe it.  I told her to stay as silent they could. I asked for their location. She said a toilet in Be’eri.
Her phone had 1% and luckily I told her to tell her friend to call me so I’ll have his phone. 
Meanwhile I’m crying hysterically and praying that she is alive, they don’t answer for one hour, I continue to tell myself “she’s alive she’s alive she’s alive “ I call everyone I know and tell them about the situation, I find a contact in the army, my father finds a contact in the news and we try to understand their location. 
then they text me “where is the army?” I’m asking for more details, they tell me about the injured and about the building, they say they are shooting nonstop outside and that their police contact they had is not answering anymore.
And again every time I loose touch for around 40minutes to one hour, so I’m looking at the clock nonstop. 
Meanwhile I’m going to bomb shelter because we have sirens and I cry non stop, can’t stop the tears and the terrible feeling. And I find myself just sitting outside when there is no siren smoking cigarettes and calling again and again to everyone I can who can help, even an old friend from high school who has a contact in the army, she tells me they dont answer.
And like this the time passes until around 4pm when im already at my friends house trying not to be alone in this. Then I get a call from dors mother, and from his friend, and then a soldier who asks me a bit info and tells me - we are on the way to get them out of there and since then they keep updating me. 
Finally I get a call from my sister when she’s in a car waiting for the roads to be clear so they can drive from there, I’m relieved and crying so much and tell her I love her.

5403,5403.0,"This reduced me to tears. I cannot imagine how worried you are right now, not to mention your parents if they are still alive. My daughter did a semester abroad in Israel several years ago. She was blessed to be there when Hamas was not as active as they have been at other times. I actually met my ex-husband on a trip to Israel. As part of our tour, we were taken to the area where the UN had established a peaceful zone between Israel and Lebanon in 1978. We later were told that the Lebanese still had border patrols in the area and chances are that armed soldiers were tracking us that afternoon. Eventually, there would be a war between Israel and Lebanon and now that UN zone is known as the Blue Line.

I went back to Israel while my daughter was there to see it with fresh eyes. We were not able to go to the Dead Sea, a huge tourist attraction, during that trip. The highway from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea was closed due to rumors of possible Palestinian hostility towards Israel in the area that day. We stayed in airBnB's during our 10 day sightseeing, often at the apartments of young professionals who had recently fulfilled the requirement to join the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) when they turned 18. I've housed Israeli Scouts in my St. Louis, MO home. They have an entertainment group that travels throughout the year performing Israeli songs and dances at performances booked at U.S. Synagogues, trying to get Jewish children excited about Israel. Many of the performers are turning 18 during their year in the Scouts Caravan and will return to Israel and immediately transition into their compulsory army service. I remember these young people and wonder how many of today's 18 year olds will survive this war. I think about my daughter and how she came home from her semester abroad with a new understanding of the realities of life in Israel. But she came home. I think about myself and am grateful that Lebanon was tensely coexisting with Israel during my visit. I think back to Yom Kippur 1973 and learning that Egypt and Syria had attacked Israel during the holiest day of the year and feeling stunned. Having grown up when I did, I'm old enough to even recall the 6 Day War of 1967 although at the time, I was too young to have more than a very basic understanding of the conflicts in the middle east and I had learned about those by watching Paul Newman in the movie, Exodus (I still own a copy and periodically rewatch it). I feel emotionally bonded to Israel. I have even thought of making Aliyah - moving to Israel and becoming a citizen - if the political situation in the U.S. gets worse. 

Realistically, I still live on the other side of the world and hear only what the news correspondents report. So while what's going on there is extremely distressing, reading a first hand account like your sister's is devastating. To think of the suffering and the destruction and fear that is overwhelming those living in Israel right now cuts like a knife. I want to do something but I have limited resources. So, I'll be grateful for those who, like your sister, are still alive and I will pray for those who, like your sister, will be forever traumatized by their experience and hope that your sister, her surviving friends and all of the others who will be touched by this war including you and your family can eventually heal.

In essence, it’s a mere game of maximizing profits and minimizing losses on each side. Each side exploits their existing conditions/resources calculates their moves accordingly towards their ends, and all actions are executed more or less according to that. 

But of course, the politicians of a country would use the media and moral justifications to align their citizens towards their ends. In that sense, most, if not all, citizens of a country would essentially believe that their country is good since they think it fights for the same ends as theirs. 

But overall, if both countries don’t see a win-win case given their constraints/goals, etc., and none wants to step back, they’d highly likely converge towards a situation in which only one winner is possible. It’s similar for N countries involved in such game.

At the end, it boils down to how the parties involved in the game adjust their goals/interests regardless of whatever moral justification one comes up with.",2023-10-08 14:45:29

Also, as far as I am informed pretty much all the the global community except for Israel agrees that territory of the West Bank as well as East Jerusalem was never meant to be part of Israel. Only Israel and probably a few allies disagrees. So it is not that disputed.

I think most people would be open to Israel actually annexing the land, but it would have to be through a one state solution. The current model, where they gradually confiscate more and more land and resettle it while driving away the former inhabitants is deeply immoral. This is where the ethnic cleansing accusations come in.

Israel will have to make a decision of whether they want to give up the land or annex it while including its inhabitants in its state. At least if it want to make any claim to being a moral state.

The two-State solution is long gone, and the current status-quo is an apartheid system; it’s unsustainable to say the least. If Jews want to have any hope of thriving in this future State where they are a minority, they will need to start supporting other Arab States in reforming Islam, making Arab culture more liberal, tolerant, and less Jew-hating. If the far-right in Israel takes power, they are likely going to try to wipe out all Arabs in Gaza and the West Bank in order to ensure they maintain majority.

Palestinians elected Hamas to lead them and have been mostly in control of their own fate since then.  Once that happened they effectively became their own ""country"".  Only a limited number of neighboring countries in the world allow you to freely hop between them.  If I want to travel to another country I need to get an approved visa.  The fact there is a wall doesn't really change anything other than enforcing boundaries between the two.  Does the USA enforcing their border with Mexico make Mexico a giant open-air prison?

Is it because they lack resources?  If so, I can understand that it might ""feel"" like a prison, but at the same time their government has received billions in aid over the last 18 years and apparently has made no progress except to build rockets and tunnels to launch attacks on Israel.  I think it is crazy generous that Israel has continue to supply utilities for Gaza as long as they have considering it is basically an enemy nation at this point.

Is it because Hamas won't let them leave to other countries?  If so, then that is an internal issue and not Israel's fault.

If Hamas had actually built up Gaza with the money they have received into a respectable territory they would probably have most of the worlds support at pushing diplomatically on Israel to give them more land that they feel entitled to. Hell, Israel would have probably been way more willing to negotiate if they weren't worried that the Palestinians were going to rape and pilliage and call for the murder of every Jew.",2023-10-11 22:30:04

""Gazans do not have free access to trade ports or control over their own ability to enter or leave, and live dependant on Israel for basic needs which can be shut off at any time"" is, I guess, too many words to say, which, fair. 

But ""prison"" conjures certain set of images that people love to share - you know those specific grey-scale dominated bombed buildings (which are real places and real damage done to real places real people live!) and that seems more appealing to both sides than the reality that Gaza managed the standard of living but had the wealth inequality it actually had under the conditions.

The term is open for interpretation intentionally to let people conjure their own image. But the existence of luxury resorts and travel visas for tourists and vetted workers doesn't negate the suffering and that people are losing lives and homes. I'm actually surprised people aren't using it more as a sign of how the people clearly just want a normal life like everyone else -- they want over priced restaurants on the beach and tasty street food, and art, and outlet malls.

But they chose an ""open air prison"" because of politics and a sense of superiority.

This is Israel's greatest tragedy - not just the catastrophic massacre in the Often Aza Kibbutzim, but also the pain and suffering that Israeli military and political leadership inflicted on the Palestinians.

This is also the Palestenians' second greatest tragedy because not only have they been suffering humiliation and inhumane conditions, but also they need to contend with the reality that they let psychopaths take over their political leadership and civil society, and that their own people are capable of such savagery.

It's a cognitive dissonance that lots of people struggle to grasp.

Of course the Palestinian people had been there much longer and are the original owners of the land, but the Jews who settled in the region didn’t have a place to go due to the rampant anti semitism in Europe at the time. Yes the solution that was agreed upon was not a good idea and obviously would lead to conflict but the situation was not ideal and options were limited. Fast forward and the entire region was untied against Israel since almost its inception as a state. The lack of anyone actually trying to look at the situation from the Israelis perspective is baffling, obviously the only way to preserve the citizens of the nation of Israel and prevent genocide would be to militarily dominate the region. Any instance of military defeat/collapse would have been catastrophic to the people who live there and they hadn’t chose where they were going in the first place. As horrible as putting Palestinians in cages and kicking them out of their rightful land is, the other side of that coin is a genocide so horrific it would rival the holocaust in death toll.

7158,7158.0,"Facts are that Israel killed way more Palestinians than the other way around.

However, how someone is killed is very important for forming opinions of observers.

For example, bombing kills way more people than beheading. However, when u see on TV a bomb was dropped you just see some smokes, and couple bloody people.

But when u see someone is being dragged from their car, raped, or beheaded. With their visceral face expressions, fear in their eyes, etc. Everyone can connect better with them. It creates bigger emotion in you as a viewer.

This effect known by advertisers and movie creators. In every movie after explosion you show people and their faces in close up. Without that, a viewer won’t be able to connect.

And western media is really good at playing this information game. Way better than any muslim nation. 

I saw hamas representative speaking and UK Palestinian ambassador speaking on TV and although they were very passionate but the only thing they sad was 1000s of Palestinians were killed during 70 years, we don’t have food, we live in occupation blab blah blah.

As an outsider this means nothing. These are just numbers. My head can’t connect with them. But when I see a naked woman dragged and paraded by gang of men. I mean, my blood just boils. And I can’t help but take Israel side. Even I know that Palestinians are the actual victims.

If Israel wants to stop terror attacks it needs to stop its own terror attacks in civilians.

Hamas aren’t freedom fighters, but nor are the IDF fighting some powerful nation unable to protect itself from it…
The reality is that Israeli government knows that radicalising the population by plunging them into poverty with no recourse will give them the justification they need to gain popular support.

And the reality is that even if you replace Palestinian with any other group of people if they are treated the same, the same thing would happen to them.

Hamas has legitimacy because it fights Isreal but also the Isreali government has legitimacy because as long as they have someone to fight they will continue to gain popular support.

7179,7179.0,"Firstly that is not the way of it at all. Just listen to how the US is talking about the situation, focussing entirely on Hamas’s evil attack while ignoring the context in which it arises, both historical and recent eg with Bibi and his settlements and so forth. The fact that they are Israel’s lawyer rather than an honest broker is part of the reason that this cannot be resolved in the first place.

Second even if that were the situation it’s very obvious why that would be. Israel is the oppressor in the broader context; they rocked up and took over occupied land after 1000 years of absence with the cooperation of Britain (largely for reasons of expediency and collective European guilt about atrocities committed against the Jews … by people other than those whose land was to be taken), made the Palestinians (or Arabs if you prefer) a minority in their own country with all the discrimination that entails, continue to settle even more land so that even a two state solution becomes increasingly hopeless, respond to armed struggle with occupation, apartheid, and endless ‘collateral damage’, etc etc. It is the same reason that white-on-black racism is not seen as morally equivalent to the converse. One side is in the wrong in macro/historical terms. 

And tbh the Israelis were willing to live with it, with their mowing the grass analogies and the like; quite happy to wear the occasional rocket and some lecturing in the press as long as they can have their nice big state and their Jerusalem etc. No doubt they figure that if they can hold it for 1000 years the right and wrong of the situation will necessarily give way to the facts on the ground and the rights that this of itself creates (which is true, though I think history will judge Israel more harshly than Saladin and the like, given modern sensibilities). Regardless, it may be that they will need to pay a bigger price than they reckoned on. It’s a very dangerous game imo to oppress that many people to that extent, particularly in a context of religious antipathy as well. It’s not like the old days where you could just slaughter them, and you can foil a thousand attacks but only one needs to get through to cause catastrophic damage.

I feel very sorry for these young Israelis that lost their lives but for myself if I was Jewish I would not migrate there and if I was born there I would immigrate. It is far from the only state founded on force of arms but imo the crime (in moral terms) is too recent, the oppression too great, and there is too much hatred.

Neither one of these sides gets to claim any moral superiority at this point. Both have targeted innocent people in their political goals. Both have engaged in war crimes while fighting for their cause. One does not justify the other. The response to violence against innocents should not be violence against innocents.

Just like you, there is a 14  year old Palestenian kid in Gaza strip feeling the same exact way. Their are many antrocities that both the IDF and Hamas have done to each side for years. Some more barbaric than others. This attack being one of them.

 Also, i know that IDF horrific actions do not represent the Israeli people. Just like Hamas terrorists horrific actions do not represent the whole Palestinians. Their is a reason this attack is so controversial, and many not feeling sorry for Israel. Its not black and white like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The conflict between Israel and Gaza is so much more complicated, with no easy solution. Dont even think their is one, other than ethnic cleansing, which would be worse and more barbaric than this attack. 


Having said that, their is no justification on Hamas attacking Israeli civilians. The kidnappings, torture, rape, murder and parading of dead bodies of elderly, women and kids is horrific and barbaric of things.

It is gross seeing palestian immigrants celebrating in western countries of this attack. I understand that they hate Israel for its own antrocities that have committed against Palestinians. It's all gross, disgusting, and no easy solution since this hatred for each other has passed on for generations and generations keep passing it down.

Hunker down and stay safe. It's going to be hard not to hate after this. This same hatred you have will be passed down to your kids, just like that same hatred that other 14 year old Palestinian in the Gaza strip will be passed on to his kids.

7646,7646.0,"Hamas just perpetrated one of the largest terrorist attacks in history. It's clear from the massacre at the concert and the videos of combatants going door to door that they were purposely targeting civilians, and the Hamas leadership and participants in the attack certainly deserve what is coming to them. 

That said, I feel it's at least important to understand the Palestinian perspective, and why so many people in the Gaza strip would partly or fully support a terrorist group like Hamas. Since 2008, according to the UN[1], over 5000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the Gaza strip, most by airstrike. It's hard to tell how many of these might be civilians, but even Israeli estimates[2] (at least from the flareup in 2014) put the number at 45%. Of course, the IDF undertakes some measures to lessen civilian causalties, Hamas operates out of civilian areas purposely, and civilian killed by the IDF are ""collateral damage"", where the military is at least trying to kill a legitimate target. Also, if Hamas had the same means as the IDF, they probably would have killed far more Israelis.

However, if you were a family member of one of the civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes, I'm sure you would feel pretty angry at the IDF, and callous towards the Israeli civilians who tacitly or explicitly support them, just as Israelis who have lost family members to the wanton rocket attacks, suicide bombings, or the most recent massacre feel the same about Palestinians. The IDF does not target civilians like Hamas, but it's clear from their tactics and the numbers above that avoiding civilian deaths is not their top priority. 

Again, I'm not equivocating Hamas and Israel, or denying Israel's people's right to defend themselves, or even disagreeing that Hamas should be toppled. I just think that you shouldn't let your justified anger work against attempts at reconciliation in the future, or lead to the unnecessary deaths of even more people.

Hamas is horrible, and should not get support what so ever. It still does not make it ok that innocent people in Gaza doesn't have basic human rights. And Israel is a part of that. The fact that Israel is a part of that, does not mean that the attacks from Hamas is ok. The leadership in both countries are commiting warcrimes and doing horrible things. Even if Hamas is worse, it doesn't make the actions of Israels goverment ok. My problem is the fact that is seems like if Hamas does something awfull, it gives Israel a free pass to do whatever for some people. Like now, Israel is responding with leveling buildings with the ground and killing a bunch of civilians. That's not ok. The attacks needs to be more targeted, they have a choice.

I am not someone who has lived under the injustice and oppression of an apartheid system and barriers in poverty, lack of opportunities, and a PAWN for other nations and a religious community to address their interests.

This is a false assertion. There are plenty of religions that don't have a home state and the idea that religions (Meaning specific sects of those religions) are entitled to create ""home states"" where they can impose religious dogma is anathema to democracy. And claiming that the Israeli government represents all of the Jews in the world is absurd. Bibi is to Judaism what Trump is to Christianity. Many Orthodox Jews reject the idea that the Israeli government represents all Jews so your claim has no virtue.

The Zionist movement began in the 19th century and was promoted by both Jews and Christian fundamentalists. It was not universally popular among Jews. Many predicted that it would lead to more antisemitism, not less. The argument was that a Jewish homeland would make Jews around the world safer. Obviously that hasn't happened.

The Jewish Diaspora started 2000 years ago. For over a thousand years, Poland was the center of Jewish civilization and culture. The Great Synagogue was in Warsaw. The Germans and the Poles completely destroyed this Jewish homeland so that today there are only about 6000 Jews left in Poland.

An apartheid system cannot stand, just as much as the constant terrorist attacks from Hamas cannot be tolerated.

Protestant christians have no concept of a home base for our different religions within protestant christianity, so its a weird concept for us.

I noticed a lot of non christians think we christians have a holy place like the jews and Muslims do. But no, we dont lol. 

And even with the vatican, its location isnt special or anything, It just happened to be there over time. No one makes pilgrimages like jewish and muslim people do. Its a big religious office for the catholics as far as most protestants are concerned lol. 

I think this makes it weird for a lot of protestant christians to  try to understand this stuff. We have no concept of a home base. So we cant empathize with losing something like that. If you lose it, just make a new one? Obviously I wouldnt suggest that, but like, idk what else to do lol. If we lost the vatican, the art and texts inside would be more devastating than the actual building. No one would care about the religious symbolism of the building if no one was hurt and no art/scripture lost. We can just make a new one, doesnt even need to be in the same spot.

We also have a history of disagreeing on which christian capitol is the REAL one lol. We had 3 different popes at once. Now we just dont care.

Now, catholics might not agree with me on that though lol, but they also dont make any pilgrimage to the vatican unless they are wealthy enough to travel in the first place. No one does it to specifically fulfil religious things.

>During the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Palestinian Arabs fought for the end of the Mandate and the creation of an Arab state based on the whole of Palestine.[8] They attacked both British and Jews as well as some Palestinian Arabs who supported a Pan-Arabism. Mainstream Zionists, represented by the Vaad Leumi and the Haganah, practiced the policy of Havlagah (restraint); Irgun militants did not follow this policy and called themselves ""Havlagah breakers.""[9] The Irgun began bombing Palestinian Arab civilian targets in 1938.[6] While the Palestinian Arabs were ""carefully disarmed"" by the British Mandatory authorities by 1939, the Zionists were not.[6] As a conciliation to the Arabs, the White Paper of 1939 was passed, imposing significant limits in Jewish immigration in the shadow of World War II.",2023-10-11 10:27:16

8762,8762.0,"Hello everyone 

Hello I’m an American Israeli now before you start to hate me can you spare a minute to hear? I am not on a side, I do not support Israel or Palestinian 
Before you run and write I hate you because “you don’t support us” let me tell you a little about myself 
I’m 16 years old I was raised in the USA and now I live in Israel 
Look I’m not saying that I do know everything even the opposite actually I don’t know anything, my entire life was simply decided by birth and my surroundings 
I grew up reading simple books like Curious Goerge and I think I still have that side in me which in these days some people don’t really understand.
Even though I grew up optimistic there was a phase that I just didn’t fit in, I was alone (alone with my thoughts) weird kid that had depression and was afraid to go out to the world because I was afraid of everything afraid of the truth that the world just isn’t fair. I understood that maybe I won’t fit in into this gray world because my mind is still stuck in the colour books when I was 5 but slowly I accepted the fact that life is not fair.

Just recently I woke up to see my mama crying watching the media of my country, I usually don’t watch tv or anything like that but yes I’m not perfect so I too sometimes stuck in my little screen to avoid the unfairness that surrounds me. But from that moment that I saw my mama and my little brother that I love so much devastated from the tv my mind clicked, I felt like I was awakened or I just knew that now that my time is now on a countdown. 
You know I was never really religious I feel like I was just simply born into religion, yes I do believe, but not in a Jewish god or greek god or Allah nor science it’s just hope.
It’s been a couple days since this war began, everyday feels like my last, sometimes at night my eyes just won’t close because of the thought of all the tanks that were filled with tears on both sides and also because my big brother was sent to the army. 

today I ate a brownie I thought that there are also people in this world that never ate brownies which made me sad but I reminded myself that maybe today is my last and I know that sadness will only resort to no good. 
I’ve realised before this war that my biggest worry was my driving lessons and my yelling teacher because I wouldn’t understand where to stop when I see the stop sign and now that worry faded.
Now before that you go on with you life, do I deserve to die?  Am I at fault for simply living life but being born with Israeli parents? Am I responsible for my country doings? Does the kid that live in Gaza deserve to die? or live a life of poverty and hate and never eat brownies? 
All that I ask of you is to question so you can see both sides but it is hard I know I’ve been there but please for the sake of the future and morality be curious don’t be one sided and accept that yes life isn’t fair",2023-10-10 20:53:38

9063,9063.0,"Sadly : Arabs , Many Palestinians included  , don't really have respect or consideration for the concept of global public opinion and legitimacy in International relations .    They think enemy nations that occupy foregin areas are a free-picking in everything about them :  including civilians  .. even anti-war ones .

They just don't understand even if said civilian was a vile person , armed , did heinous things towards ""the other"" people ,   a military reservist , or even a war criminal or former soilder who made atrocities   :  killing him in the name of a national  cause ,  says something entirely else about it than killing active combatants on service .

This  mentality  is what made them pay the dear price  that most people view Palestinian political activates are not towards self-determination statehood rather than ad-hominems aganist Israeli-Jews solely because they are Israelis , and in some extreme cases : just because of thier Jewish ethnicity  .

There is a thin line in being a militant who is  a guerilla freedom-fighter , and scum bags like ISIS .. Many Palestinians forget thier original problem that is indeed of legitmate greviances (self-determination , and statehood , and the right to live as a nation in its homeland ) with the Israeli-state all-together  and just focus on spiting Israelis just for the sake of vengeance and despise  .  Those supporting such  militants are of that type .

..Again : It's no secret Hamas wants such bloodbaths : it's already reflected in thier charter and what they have been doing  since 2006 ... It's just quite shocking to see they actually kept thier word in trying to recreate  the 7th century , even if it involves so much blood  , and just for the sake of doing it .

&#x200B;

As for the schoolyard comparison :  the Israeli-state did a hell of lot more than just ""bullying"" Palestinians .  It's more like ruining the foundations of thier  lives :   taking Homes , livelihood , families , and  most important of all : the right to exist as nation  , with a sovereign state in its own homeland .  That dosen't excuse bloodthirsty vendetta  or grant the right to do the same to others : but it explains the basis of how at least most Palestinians think .

Just want to say : I hope everybody stays safe , and nobody else gets hurt .. those bastards (No offense to those who cheer-on Hamas , despite condoning or consenting to bloodshed ) probably just want a hostage exchange  , similar to what Black September tried  doing in 1972 Munich ...just hope this time it ends quickly  , and Hamas gets what they want and leave .

Israel is a legal, recognized state - a country. Palestine is not. They won’t come to the negotiation table recognizing that Jews and Israel have the right to exist. They (Hamas, Iran) only want to destroy and kill all Jews (actual genocide by definition) as they have during their attacks. Murdering women and children, cutting off babies heads, killing kids in front of parents, raping women. Killing in the most horrendous ways. That is Palestine. That is Iran. Would you allow someone to be your neighbor that does this or would you force them out?  You would remove the threat or yourself from the situation. 

Forcing them to relocate to an Arab country and destroying their occupied areas is the only option. These people do not now nor never will want peace as long as Iran calls their shots.

This might seem puzzling. But my firm belief is that acknowledging the suffering of the civil population of one people while ignoring the suffering of the other is not only immoral. It is one of the key mechanisms underlying the self-perpetuating nature of conflicts. 

Whether you identify as pro-palestinean or pro-israeli I believe that you should have an interest in guarding the civil population of both sides. Because crimes against one civil population can and will be used to justify crimes against the other.

Also let me be clear as I represent the ""pro-Israeli"" side - which imo is only a name given by people who don't know that this conflict is not in back and white. WE DO NOT WANT CIVILIANS TO DIE. Ever. If you see someone on either side of this conflict encourage the killing of civilians, know that most of us wholly condemn this.

The reason why Israel is not the same as Hamas is because there is a CLEAR difference between actively targeting civilians and being caught in a crossfire. Hamas targeted civilians, putting it with the likes of ISIS. Israel targets buildings where weapons are being stored or are being used for terrorist planning. When Israel alerts residents to leave and Hamas forces them to stay where they are - civilians lose their lives. This is the key difference that pro-pali supports just cant seem to wrap their heads around. If you don't see the difference I don't know what to tell you. Also the nuclear power comment is silly. Israel will never use nukes on Gaza so this is a ridiculous thing to bring up.

Lastly, people bring up the LGBT thing not to justify killing Gazans, but to show the clear hypocrisy of the pro-LGBT+ crowd who show support to a people who would certainly murder them, while Israel allows anyone to be LGBT+. This again, is not justification for violence, but simply to point out the delusion of supporting a group of people who would certainly not support you back.

There various other reasons calling them ISIS besides beheading babies. 

If you’re going to present the “whataboutism” argument, at the very least do some basic research about this conflict. This isn’t the first period nor time Israel has experienced isolated major terror attacks on their civilians by Hamas. This is a very shocking even because of the scale (1300 deaths in one day) of murder and inhumane behavior displayed by Hamas, like an ISIS milita takeover. But to present the accumulation of years of abuse by Israel on Palestine while being obtuse about the long history of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians as well.. Silly. 

It makes a lot of sense to criticize Pro LGBT organization suffering cognitive dissonance and support Palestinian activism that supports Hamas attacks. No one is criticizing them for supporting UN humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians.

412,42.0,"> Biden claimed that he saw photos of beheaded babies... then the white house retracted that claim.

> They're using this to justify a genocide against all Gazans, 

There is no genocide going on.  Why would Israel be bothering with expensive precision munitions rather than cheap dumb artillery if the goal were genocide?  This is simply a lie.

> On the other hand, Gazans have been producing proof FOR YEARS of all the civilians, including babies, that Israel has killed, and this has never made a difference to the pro-Israel crowd.

Well no.  In general the pro-Israel crowd finds Gazan policy abhorrent.  Gaza is the one who declared war.  Gaza is the one who insists on attacking.  Gaza is the one who has kept this thing going for 17 years.  Gaza could very easily have decided to be Singapore but they didn't. 

> But if murdering babies makes a group as bad as ISIS... why isn't this line of reasoning also used against the government of Israel 

Because ""murder"" isn't collateral damage. Murder requires specific intent.  Israel tries to hit military targets against an army that does not practice distinction.  That is Hamas doesn't wear uniforms, they don't mark their military buildings and they don't separate them from civilian infrastructure.  That's going to increase the number of Gazan civilian fatalities.  Israel has some responsibility to be cautious here.  But the government with ultimate responsibility for the well being of Gazans is Hamas, their government. 

Hamas, atypically for them, decided to conduct an attack to cause maximum moral outrage.  That's an ISIS tactic.'

> That same logic can be used to justify literally every genocide in the early 20th century and earlier, since nearly everyone was homophobic back then. 

First off the question being raised is that Israel was a leader on these issues in the 1990s.  Just as they (the Yishuv and Israel) had been a leader on women's roles from the 1920s onwards.   Today they are a bit of a laggard so the argument isn't as sticky.  

In any case Palestinians values are mostly in line with the dramatic shifts in the rest of the Arab world.  Those dramatic shifts are very bad, but I think Egyptians and Saudis deserve a lot of the blame and Palestinians almost none of it.  It does however provide one of many many reasons that the Israeli society should be the one to win out over the Palestinian culture.  

As for your historical point I'll briefly dissent.  Societies say in the 1950s certainly were homophobic by today's standards.  But there were well known ""confirmed bachelors"" who had ""stable roommates"". Or ""spinsters"" who lived together.  Tolerance rather than social sanction was a norm.  Many things were considered fine if you kept them quiet.  1950s culture was about agreeing to appear to conform to rigid expectations, because of that actual ideological conformity was less important to them.  Today people can get horribly  disciplined for the slightest misstep.

Indiscriminately bombing a densely-populated strip of land is not simply collateral damage. If Israel ACTUALLY wanted to avoid killing civilians, they would've sent soldiers to kill Hamas militants.

>Hamas forces them to stay where they are

If this is true (please provide a source if you have one), again, why doesn't Israel send soldiers instead of carpet bombing? If they know they're going to kill civilians, why do they continue to do it? And how does Hamas force Gazan civilians to stay? With threats of death? If that was the case, wouldn't they try to fight and escape since both options are death? It's not adding up.

>clear hypocrisy of the pro-LGBT+ crowd who show support to a people who would certainly murder them

How is it hypocrisy? There's nothing contradictory about being against genocide. China currently puts Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps; are only straight people allowed to voice their condemnation, since these Uyghurs are probably homophobic? How does this logic work? Again: Everybody in the early 20th century and earlier was homophobic. Are we not allowed to condemn genocides in that period unless we're straight?

>the goal of the Israeli military is to eliminate Hamas, not all of Gaza
