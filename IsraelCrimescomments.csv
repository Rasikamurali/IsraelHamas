In the tapestry of resistance, the Palestinian Keffiyeh weaves a powerful narrative of defiance and resilience. 🇵🇸✊ As more than just a fabric, it stands as an emblem of the indomitable spirit that refuses to be silenced.

Worn with pride, the Keffiyeh tells the tale of a people who endure, resist, and persist in the face of adversity. Its distinctive black and white pattern transcends fashion; it is a visual declaration of solidarity and an unwavering commitment to justice.

Through the years, this iconic piece of cloth has become a symbol of the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and freedom. It's a tangible link to a storied past, a reminder that resistance is etched into the very fabric of their identity.

Whether draped across shoulders or worn with purpose, the Palestinian Keffiyeh is a call to action, urging the world to stand alongside those who fight for a just cause. As we honor its symbolism, let us amplify the voices of those who use it to speak volumes in their quest for a brighter, liberated tomorrow. 🌍🤍🖤 #PalestinianKeffiyeh #SymbolOfResistance #FreePalestine

"“Since the start of the war” so you’re referring to October 7th, right? The “war” for Palestinians has never ended. The oppression they’ve faced is clear as day and I’m not going to sit here to prove it to anyone that knows how to use google or read a book. I have done enough of that with people in my life and I’m truly exhausted.

I have a wonderful Jewish community I’m surrounded by, and I am very well aware antisemitism exists. It shouldn’t feel like a competition of who can hurt who more but clearly that’s what zionists want you to turn this into. And THEY are the reason Jewish communities who are facing anti semitism aren’t getting the support they deserve. It goes as far as calling their own people - a Jewish person, anti semitic for showing support to Palestine. 

Anytime something happens to a Muslim individual, people love to bring up “but but.. we face it too.” No one said you haven’t? Why do you have to make it a point to prove it? Pro-Palestinians can acknowledge that their fellow Jewish communities don’t deserve to face a hate crime. At least I can. But Zionists love to justify what’s happening to Muslims. It’s sickening. Can the Muslim community grieve for just a second without comments like this? No. They can’t. Because they “all deserve it and are all terrorists.” NOBODY will call the guy who shot these 3 innocent boys a terrorist. But if it was the other way around, you know exactly how that would go already.  

I truly don’t even know what I’m saying anymore. None of this probably made sense and I’m just over the obvious disregard towards Muslims. Im not necessarily coming at you in this OP, but it’s comments like the ones in the screenshot above, that take away from Jewish people who are actually facing hate crimes because of the Zionists being psychotic.",2023-11-26 15:41:10
"well as far as I know so far for the pro Palestinians attacks : one little kid was brutality stabbed to death, one college kid was thrown from balcony ( although officials say it was suicide) , and two guys got shot and seriously injured ( hope they make it ) , while on the pro Israeli side one girl was shot outside the synagogue ( officials say the gun shot was by mistake) , so you tell me",2023-11-26 15:28:45

"Thank you. I truly appreciate this. It just infuriates me how people try to say Muslims have hatred towards Jews and that it’s, ""in our Quran."" If they knew anything about the Quran, Allah wants anything but hatred toward anyone, let alone because of their religion. [The only time you are allowed to “fight” is when it comes to defending yourself.. and in the case of Palestinians, they’ve had to defend themselves since Israelis arrived into their land.](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8fU6GcR/) Fun fact, a Muslim man can marry a Jewish or Christian woman. If our religion’s sole purpose was to hate any religion but ours, why would that even be the case? 

It’s all just bogus and what Muslims have faced time and time again. Honestly, the anxiety and fear I feel now is 10x worse than when Trump was elected. Which was pretty awful too. You might already know some or all of this stuff but maybe someone else will learn something new today.

Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read my lengthy reply. I hope you have a good rest of your day/night, wherever you are ❤️.

Edit: linked the verse of the Quran.
Edit 2: following the translations of the Quran can sometimes be a bit difficult, especially in cases like this one where it’s not the full verse.

"It’s a very sad reality :( 

Sometimes deceased adults can look like mannequins/dolls as well, but babies (especially a baby as young as the one in this post) tend to ESPECIALLY look like dolls due to the fact they have hardly any wrinkles, hardly any visual pores (if at all), and of course— no apparent signs of aging on the skin. So when the baby goes into pallor mortis— an early stage in the decomposition process in which blood pools to the place in the body with the heaviest gravitational pull, such as the feet of somebody who has died by hanging, for example— and that blood no longer circulates, causing the corpse to appear pale with little to no variation of color to the skin. Death also causes the eyes of the deceased to become glossy, another characteristic similar to that of a doll. When you put all of those traits together, you unfortunately are left with a baby’s body that looks eerily doll-like.",2023-12-01 17:37:06
