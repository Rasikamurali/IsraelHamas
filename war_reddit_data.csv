IsraelPalestine,A war started in Israel,,07/10/2023 11:54:11,"A war started in Israel.  Dead bodies in kibbutzim near Gaza, Hamas shoots civilians and sets their houses on fire.  My friend is hiding in his house in the same bedroom, in the same bed I slept in yesterday before I returned home to the center of the country.  He answers intermittently, paralyzed by fear, with yes and no answers.  Says - they are shooting at me.  His friends were shot.  Now my messages have stopped being received, and I don't know what's going on with him.  thousands are injured right now, most of them seriously, hundreds of civilians killed according to what seems to be in the news right now, and the information is not updated.  More and more innocent people are being killed all the time.  Squads of terrorists take over the streets.  There are screams on the news behind the reporter as he holds back from crying as a man screams after losing his only daughter and women beat themselves up in hysterics.  At a party in nature ,terrorists arrived and started shooting at 2000 young people who were dancing, they didn't hear the alarms warning of the rockets because of the music, and suddenly realized that they were being shot at in 360 degrees, the Hamas men were so close that they could see the green band of Hamas on their faces.  Citizens in the Gaza Strip are closed and hiding in a room, women, babies, men and old people, while the terrorists are in their house.  People hide in pits and garbage cans to save themselves.  My brother will probably be ordered to fight soon.  my mother is crying.  They hold hostages, even old people.  It's exhausting.  Of course, for them they serve a ""noble purpose"" and killing these children and innocents will bring them to heaven.","['This is terrorism, no other explanation is valid when women and children are being murdered indiscriminately.

I absolutely understand how Hamas must be removed if there is any hope of peace in the future.  That being said, the images out of Gaza are tough to watch.  The utter destruction of entire blocks and the sight of children in hospitals crying in pain is really messing with my head. I just can't imagine living in an environment where huge rockets could rain down on me in any moment. Again, I understand what Israel is trying to do here, but I also truly feel the pain of so many of the innocent lives being lost in Gaza. I would hope there are people in Gaza who can understand the pain that israelis felt on October 7th as well.

If this is any comfort, know this: if this ""war"" wouldn\'t be covered live by everyone interested with a cellphone in their pocket, the atrocities would make what\'s happening now look like extreme restraint, small in scale and motion.

Nevertheless, these are the conditions of engagement that Hamas chooses. Hamas knows perfectly well how painful it is for most people to witness children suffering. Therefore, lacking military parity with Israel, they attempt to maximize the suffering of their own children -- and, more importantly, to HIGHLIGHT that suffering via all forms of media. The suffering is real, but Hamas has helped arrange it. It\'s not FAKE, but it is propaganda. Everybody knew perfectly well that Israel was going to cause immense damage to the north half of Gaza. There\'s no excuse for any children being there. Anybody with the slightest bit of intelligence and free will would have started walking south. This is a form of warfare that\'s a challenge to Western notions of the rules of war, but ultimately, one cannot dictate to an enemy force how they choose to fight. If they line up behind women and children, and march them in a line toward your guns, hiding behind them the entire way, and are prepared to engage once they\'re close enough, you really only have two choices: kill some women and children, or risk losing the battle (and potentially the war). There really are no other choices. The irony is that Hamas has all kinds of arguments about why Israel has committed ""war crimes"" or ""violated international norms"" or whatever. Hamas violates rules of war that even Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun decided were too cowardly.

IsraelPalestine,People are showing their true colors as the war goes on,Discussion,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"Is it just me that is noticing how as it goes on more and more pro-Palestinian posts and comments are starting to replace the word Israel with Jews? I saw a post on IG from a Jewish family living in america who was just posting a wholesome video of their family and kids on the swing set. The comments were flooded with “free Palestine” and how they were going to make them pay for what Israel has done. Like what? These people have nothing to do with the conflict and might not even support Israel. 

I have seen numerous examples of this and as time goes on, more and more people are starting to display that they don’t give a damn about Palestine, they just hate Jews.

How to ensure the security of Palestine and Israel?

1. A buffer zone between Israel and Palestine.

IsraelPalestine,It looks like Israel is close to winning this war and I hope it will do so after the war,,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"1.After occupying Gaza, hand over control to the United Nations and ban Hamas.

2.Conduct elections in Palestine (including Gaza, West Bank and East Jerusalem), supervised by a delegation of international observers.

3.End the blockade of Gaza and allow trade.

4.Stop the establishment of settlements in the West Bank and grant dual citizenship to residents of Israeli-controlled settlements.

5.Replace the existing nation-state law with a new secular basic law that does not distinguish between races, give Arabic and Hebrew the same official language, and guarantee the Palestinians’ right of return.

IsraelPalestine,About the war going on right now.,Discussion,10/10/2023 17:48:20,"Hello,  
I'll start off by saying that I am a 29 years old Israeli who, like most able bodied adult in Israel has served in the IDF (I wasn't really a ""fighter"" per se, I served in a Search and rescue unit that's main purpose was to rescue trapped civilians in collapsed buildings after missile strikes or deal with ABC warfare (atomic, biological and chemical)).

  
After reading through posts and comments on the matter of the war I would like to say but one thing and that is I urge anyone who actually thinks he understand what Hamas is, to download the app ""Telegram"" and search the word ""Hamas"" in it, you'll quickly find yourself in a group of Hamas soldiers and see posts that were uploaded from the very terrorists who attacked Israel on Saturday morning and I assure you, after you see a group of terrorists kill people without batting an eye, raping women one after the other just to kill them when their done, you will understand what they are.  
If you think for a second that the IDF or any Israeli for that matter is capable of such atrocities, the people who were slaughtered by the millions not a 100 years ago and still have living proofs from that time, I promise you, we are not.  
My heart goes out to the civilians of Gaza who are tormented by Hamas, I wish I could save you all, and hopefully the government of Israel will act in a way that'll allow you to live freely, because no decent human being can support such crimes against a fellow man.

IsraelPalestine,Is Israel actually losing the public opinion war?,Opinion,01/11/2023 01:08:42,"Opinion polls indicate that the public support for Israel is actually at a 20-year-high, and has remained high despite the ground incursion in Gaza. A [WSJ/Ipsos poll](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/americans-back-israel-but-are-wary-of-getting-pulled-into-conflict-wsj-ipsos-poll-finds-3abce44b#) from 20 Oct found an increase from 27% to 42% Americans taking the Israeli side, and a decrease from 7% to 3% siding with the Palestinians, compared to before Hamas' massacre. 75% Americans have a favourable view of the Israeli people, up from 67% in 2022.

Regarding the U.N. Resolutions, the GA has always been heavily against Israel, because of the Arab voting block. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/17jcuwa/comment/k71ixpt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is a good overview:

> Because Arab lobbying bloc. It is a guaranteed ~100 votes from the OIC nations and poor African states, as well as a few key abstentions from East Asia for almost every resolution. The Arabs can pretty much strongarm anything through the UNGA. [...] This is why Israel realized as early as the 1960s, that it was no use reacting to every UNGA resolution. Abba Eban, one of Israel's biggest diplomatic figures, quipped:""If Algeria introduced a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it, it would pass by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions.""

Remember that the [UN GA Resolution 3379](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_3379), declaring Zionism itself ""a form of racism and racial discrimination"", was in effect between 1975-91. The international support for Israel has risen significantly since then.

Even the Arab world has sticked by the Abraham accords, all the while condemning Israel in words. For example, the Chairmen of Foreign Affairs Committee at the UAE Federal National Council [said today](https://ejpress.org/are-the-abraham-accords-stronger-thant-the-war-between-israel-and-hamas/) that ""The [Abraham] Accords are our future"" and ""We want everyone to acknowledge and accept that Israel is there to exist"". The Saudis too have [indicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17g2cnf/white_house_saudis_mbs_indicates_israel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that normalisation is still on the cards once the war with Hamas is over.

IsraelPalestine,The IDF is committing war crimes! Or is it?,,16/11/2023 22:15:50,"Forward: There are a lot of accusations flowing around that Israel is committing war crimes. Most people just throw those accusations without knowing what a war crime is and how urban combat is fought, for example not every civilian death is a war crime and fighting in a city is also not a war crime. So, this is meant to be a kind of a guide to the rules of war in urban warfare. If you really care about the situation and you don’t just want to throw words like “war crimes” around I suggest you give this a read. 

  
Chapter 1 – understanding Urban warfare:  
To understand the legality and morality of Israel’s actions in Gaza it is important to understand what urban warfare is and how destructive it is by its nature, especially when fighting a group like Hamas that uses Guerrilla tactics.   
Urban warfare is the most devastating type of warfare from a civilian and military casualties’ perspective. A good example to put the war in Gaza into perspective is the battle of Mosul against ISIS. According to the British ministry of defense at least 9,000 civilians were likely killed in Mosul and most of the city turned into uninhabitable ruins. And other Urban battles against militant forces thought history have resulted in similar outcomes. But why?  
Because of the tactics used by militant forces, and because of the density of the cities. The militant force usually uses civilian infrastructure as military bases of operations, and they hide among civilians. Because of this no matter how hard the attacking force tries to minimize civilian casualties, their numbers would still be high. Sometimes simply because of their presence in the area, they can get caught in the crossfire between the attacking force and the defending militant force. And the attacking force always has to balance between protecting civilians and protecting its troops. For Example, if a militant force fires from a building with civilians inside, an attacking force eliminating the threat risks killing civilians but not eliminating the threat risks the attacking’s force troops dying. This is just one of thousands of different scenarios you could meet in an urban battle. This is one of the reasons why evacuating civilians is so important.

  
Chapter 2- Understanding the situation in Gaza:  
In Gaza the situation is even more difficult than it was in Mosul. For one, there are more militants in Gaza. Hamas and the Islamic Jihad have more than 30,000 militants in the Gaza strip (ISIS had around 10,00-12,000 militants in Mosul). Gaza city is more densely populated than Mosul and Hamas had 15 years to build their infrastructure because they had control over and served as the government of Gaza since they won the Palestinian civil war against Fatah in 2007. Hamas has weapon storages and command centers in civilian buildings, they have tunnels everywhere and in particular under Hospitals and schools and they shoot rockets at Israel from densely populated areas, rockets that sometimes fail and land in Gaza causing destruction and civilian casualties. For example, according to the IDF since the start of the war more than 1000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets have landed inside the Gaza strip. One can only imagine how many of civilians died because of those rockets. Especially considering the fact that they fall in random places. Furthermore, it is important to note that there is a problem with the number of casualties coming out of Gaza. Hamas controls the Gaza health ministry that provides those numbers and they don’t provide any numbers about the number of militants killed. Taking into account the fact that their militants wear civilian clothing so they can easily be identified as civilians and it is likely that they are counted as such. If we look at the 2014 war in Gaza about 33%-44% of the casualties were terrorists (estimates vary because of the points stated earlier). while a total of 60% of all casualties were males of age fit to fight. It is safe to assume that the numbers in the cornet war would be similar.    
  
Chapter 3- introduction to international laws of war:  
The international laws of war or ILOW in short have 3 main principles used to decide whether an action is legal or not.   
Those are military necessity, proportionality and honor  
Now it is important to note the ILOW principles and laws apply differently when talking about war between two state militaries and a fight between a military force and a militant force.  
Military necessity - “justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible.” Or in other words, how much does the action contribute the military goal. For example, destroying a weapons storage hinders the enemy’s ability to fight you and thus it is a military necessity. Actions that aren’t necessary to achieve the military goals are forbidden. For example, targeting specifically civilian populations is not a military necessity. Now when the enemy uses civilian infrastructure like in Gaza you go into a grey area which leads us to the second principal.    
proportionality – “requires that even when actions may be justified by military necessity, such actions not be unreasonable or excessive.” Now this one is a lot of times misunderstood. There isn’t a ratio between civilian casualties and militant casualties or between casualties on both sides that must not be passed. This principal means that when you take some sort of action the military gain must be high enough to justify possible harm that could be caused to civilians. For example, killing a commander that hides in a civilian area can be considered justified because a high-ranking commander’s death can greatly hinder the enemy’s ability to fight. Though the harm to civilians should be minimized as much as possible. The two sides must also distinguish between the civilian population and the fighting force. This basically says that you cannot target civilians. And when one of the sides uses the civilian population as human shields (which is forbidden), the other side must try to distinguish between those two as much as it can.  
Honor- Basically says that all parties must respect the principles and rules of war.  
Now you may notice that those principles aren’t black and white and it is because war is complicated and there is an understanding that no matter how hard you try civilian harm cannot be entirely avoided, especially in urban combat like mentioned earlier.  
  
Chapter 4 – Israel’s approach to protecting civilians:  
Israel implements several approaches to protect the civilian population inside of the war zone. First of all, Israel implements a system of warning people inside of buildings by calling and “roof knowing” which is dropping a small ammunition on the roof of the buildings to make the people get out before they bomb the building. They do it whenever possible even though it helps militants escape too. Furthermore, Israel has been evacuating the areas where the center of the fighting is. Days before they started the ground invasion, they have called for civilians in Gaza city to evacuate south where it is relatively safer, and where humanitarian aid is allowed to flow. Even after the ground invasion has started the IDF has kept an evacuation route open on a daily basis to allow civilians to escape. Israeli troops also have orders to shoot only at militants.  
When dealing with buildings like Hospitals that Hamas uses, Israel goes slowly and lets civilians escape before they go in. For example, they have been in the Shifa hospital area a few days before they started an operation in the building.      
  
Chapter 5 – Analyzing Israel’s actions:  
First of all, lets determine if the act of Israel going to war itself is legal. The answer is yes. After Hamas attacked Israel, butchered its people and took more than 200 hostages. Israel has the right to fight them back. According to international law a country has the right to defend itself from state or non-state actors. Also, the goal of eliminating Hamas can be considered legal because Hamas poses a risk to the people living in Israel. So, Israel has the right to ensure that Hamas won’t be able to harm its people again.   
Now even though the act of war itself is legal Israel still has to respect the laws of war so let’s examine them.  
The targets:  
As mentioned before Hamas’s military infrastructure and militants are imbedded inside of the civilian population of Gaza. And according to the rules of war, if one side uses civilian areas for military purposes those areas become legal targets. For example, if Hamas uses a house to store weapons this house is a legal military target.   
With that out of the way lets examine Israel’s targets according to the three principles of war. First of all, the targets Israel picks are military targets. It attacks weapon storages, command centers, tunnel entrances, missile launching sites, units like anti-tank units and other Hamas militants, high ranking commanders and more. The problem is that they are all placed inside of civilian areas. But all of those targets pass the military necessity test because they hinder Hama’s ability to fight. For example, destroying a launching site hinders Hamas’s ability to launch rockets into Israel and destroying a command center hinders Hamas ability to stay coordinated.   
Now let’s look at proportionality, Israel uses a lot of precision guided missiles to eliminate its targets. Ammunition like that helps minimize civilian harm because it strikes the exact target. Now does it mean that civilians don’t die in these strikes? No, as I said no matter how hard you try to minimize civilian lose, there would still be civilian loses. Israel’s implementation of warning people in the buildings when it can, shows that it is also distinguishing between militants and civilians. Remember that the IDF always has to balance between protecting civilians in Gaza and protecting its soldiers and Israeli civilians.   
In the rules of war there are building which are considered protected like hospitals and mosques. But when a group like Hamas uses them for military purposes, they lose their protected status. Israel is also seen implementing the principal of proportionality and distinction when dealing with those buildings. When they went to clear the Shifa hospital and other hospitals they moved slowly and provided time for civilians to escape. They also went in with medical and arab speaking personal to help the civilians inside. which also shows that they distinguish between civilians and militants.  
Forcible displacement of civilians versus lawful evacuation:  
“The prohibition on forcible displacement is subject to an important exception in cases where the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons (such as clearing a combat zone) require the evacuation” Israel asking civilian to evacuated northern Gaza because it is an active war zone is not only legal but it shows that Israel implements the principal of proportionality and distinguishing because they evacuate civilians to safer areas. Israel also put troops on the evacuation corridors to secure them after Hamas blocked them.   
Siege tactics, “collective punishment” and access to humanitarian relief:  
Siege tactics are allowed to be used in combat but they also must respect the principles of war. Israel allows aid to flow into southern Gaza, each day hundreds of trucks pass through the Rafa gate. And remember that even though the Rafa gate is on the Egyptian side, all the trucks must get inspected by Israel to check if they contain weapons and so Israel decides if aid is allowed in or not. Israel does not allow aid to flow into the north of Gaza where most of the fighting is thus putting it under siege. This passes the military necessity test because it hinders Hamas’s ability to fight. And the fact that the IDF evacuates civilians from the north to the south where aid is available shows that they distinguish between civilians and militants. This distinguishment also shows that it is not a collective punishment. In addition, Israel has to allow aid to flow in but they are not the ones responsible for where the aid lands in the end. If the claims that Hamas stockpiles fuel and steals aid are true (and there is some evidence that it is) than Hamas is at fault for aid not getting to civilians in Gaza, not Israel. Also, when Israel encircled the Shifa hospital and effectively put it under siege they allowed aid to pass to the hospital.  
In my conclusion, according to the information available at this time it seems that Israel is flowing the rules of war. Some people may think differently.

A decades-long court case of homeowners vs tenants who didn’t pay rent concluded that the tenants needed to pay rent to the owners of the property, (bought and documented in 1875 to live near the burial ground of the 4th c. BCE Jewish leader Shimon Hatzadik,) or leave.\n\n2. “Israel took over Al Aqsa.”\nAl Aqsa is in Israel. It also ""happens"" to be built on the holiest site in Judaism - Temple Mount. Despite this, Israel gave administrative control to the Jordanian Waqf, while Israel maintains security control. In turn, the Waqf doesn’t allow Jews to pray on Temple Mount - our holiest site. Israel did not take over Al Aqsa, nor did it threaten to. However, it has been used for years by Islamist radicals as a place of storage for boulders and rocks to hurl at Jews and other worshippers at the Western Wall below, as well as at security forces. Israel is the only place in the Middle East that guarantees and protects freedom of worship for all faiths, while having to take serious security threats into consideration.""\n\n3. “Israel maintains an illegal occupation.”\nArabs rejected the 1947 partition, thus never forming a country in the allocated territories. From 1948 to 1967 Gaza and West Bank were occupied by Egypt and Jordan, respectively, with 0 protests from the UN or Arabs living in those territories. Neither county granted citizenship to the vast majority of Palestinian Arabs, preferring to leave them in refugee camps and weaponizing generations against Israel. In 1967, tiny Israel was simultaneously attacked by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, with assistance of Iraq, Lebanon, and armed by the Soviet Union. Miraculously, Israel came out victorious, while Jordan, Egypt, and Syria fled. Israel, despite having been attacked, offered to returned ALL of the land in exchange for peace, rejected by Arab league in Khartoum.\nThe territories in question are not occupied, but remain disputed under international law.\nIn 2005 Israel completely evacuated from Gaza, removing 8,000 Jews from their homes, in hopes that Gaza would become a peaceful Palestinian state. There is no Israeli presence in Gaza (even Jewish cemeteries had to be exhumed!). Greenhouses and other infrastructure left for Palestinians to use was torched by Arab mobs. Within a few months, internationally recognized terror organization Hamas, funded by Iran and dedicated to the murder of all Jews and total destruction of Israel, came to power. It has brutally suppressed freedoms, investing most of its resources into weapons, rockets and terror tunnels, instead of improving lives of its people.\n\n4. “Israel builds homes in the West Bank.”\nThere have always been Jews in the West Bank - it’s literally called Judea and Samaria because it’s the Biblical heartland of the Jewish history and where the Jews are from. It\'s where Kings Saul, David and Solomon started the Jewish monarchy in the 9th c. BCE, where the Jews retuned to from Babylonian exile in the 5th c. BCE, where the Chanukah events occurred in the 3rd c. BCE, where some of the holiest and most important Jewish texts of Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud were completed in 2-4 c. CE, where Maimonides kissed the ground in the 12th c., where waves of immigrants fulfilled their dreams to return to their home from all over the world in all eras, be it 18th c. Chassidic Jews, 16th c. Spanish exiles, or 5th c. Talmudic sages.\nEven since the 1850s, Jews were the majority population in Jerusalem. Expecting Jews to leave is expecting ethnic cleansing of Jews from the Holy land where we’ve always lived.\n\n5. “Israel maintains a siege in Gaza.”\nThat’s literally impossible, since Gaza also has a border with Egypt.\nIsrael maintains security borders like any other country. You must have a visa to enter, and people from Gaza get plenty of visas when needed. Due to Gaza’s tendency to import rockets which are used on Israeli citizens, Israel blockades arms shipments and inspects all imports at the border, allowing all safe materials through, including providing water, electricity, and tons of daily food supplies and other essentials.\n\n6. “Israel started it.”\nPA/Fatah leader Abbas, now in the 17th year of his 4 year presidency term, canceled the long-anticipated elections just weeks ago and decided to escalate violence against Israel as a perfect distraction. Hence, weeks of dozens of violent tic-toc filmed assaults on Jews in Jerusalem, encouraging violent rock throwing riots at al-Aqsa through Ramadan, and taking credit for a drive by murder shooting on three Jewish youth, one of whom died. Then an eviction case was used to fuel more unrest.\nNot to be upstaged, Hamas and Islamic Jihad had to tap into its upgraded rocket arsenal to be seen as champions of al-Aqsa. NOTHING justifies the deliberate war crime of firing rockets onto civilians. The rockets killed 9 already, including at least 2 Israeli Arabs... Every death, Jewish or Arab, is celebrated by terrorists.\n\n7. “Those rockets are nothing but fireworks.”\nThey are absolutely deadly, and have already killed many civilians, and destroyed many homes, buildings, schools, synagogues, and playgrounds. One even managed to break through a bomb shelter, and kill a 6 year old child hiding inside.\n\n8. “Israel’s response is disproportionate.”\nA country’s very first obligation is to the safety of its citizens. If the country’s civilians are under direct attack, there is only one proportionate response, and that is to ensure that the civilians are safe again.\n\n9. “But there are way more deaths on the other side.”\nIsrael’s responsibility is to make sure there are zero deaths on its side. Israel invests heavily into defensive technology like Iron Dome to protect its civilians. Hamas wantonly uses its civilians as human shields, stockpiling weapons in schools, hospitals, and other densely populated urban targets.\n\n10. “Israel is strong and Gaza is poor. It’s not fair.”\nHamas chose to invest BILLIONS into terror infrastructure instead of the welfare of its people. There’s nothing fair about war. But there doesn’t need to be one! Israel would not attack Gaza, if Gaza never attacked Israel’s citizens. Weaker does not make one right. Evil is evil. For example, North Korea might be weaker than Japan, but it is not the hero if it launches rockets at them.\n\n11. “Israel is killing civilians in Gaza.”\nIsrael has a huge challenge, because Hamas and Islamic Jihad hide their bases and equipment inside civilian buildings, including schools and hospitals. Despite this, Israel goes to extreme efforts to avoid civilian casualties. Israel is extremely precise in its targets, and always gives civilians advance warning, by first distributing flyers or calling people in the vicinity to warn them hours ahead, and then giving an additional five-minute warning with a safe “tap” on the roof. This is why there are so many videos of Gaza buildings falling - everyone around was warned and knew they would fall.\nOn the other hand, 1 in 4 of the rockets Hamas and Islamic Jihad shoot into Israel fall short, and land in Gaza on its own people. These fall on civilians with no warning siren, and have killed many innocent women and children.\nIsrael only targets Hamas militants and commanders who are actively trying to kill Israeli civilians.\n\n12. “Gaza doesn’t have bomb shelters.”\nIf they didn’t shoot rockets at Israel, they wouldn’t need. By the way, those rockets cost $45,000 each. Hamas is spending over $31 million dollars a day attacking Israeli citizens, instead of protecting their own.\n\n13. “Look at these horrible pictures of dead children in Gaza.”\nDo a reverse google search, more often than not, those pictures are actually from Syria.\n\n14. “Zionism is evil. Not all Jews are Zionists.”\nJudaism is focused on a longing for Zion - Jerusalem, and Israel. Jews are from Zion/Jerusalem. For over 2,500 years Jews have been praying three times a day, and at every meal, for the return of all Jews to Zion. You cannot separate the Holy Land of Israel and Jerusalem from Judaism. Modern day political Zionism asserts the right of Jews for self-determination, like all other people have.\n\n15. “Israelis are European colonizers.”\nJews are indigenous to Israel. Some Jews lived in Europe because colonizing forces exiled them from Israel. Currently, 52% of Israel\'s Jews are actually from Moslem countries from which they were expelled in the past 80 years, from Morocco to Iran. In addition, not all Israelis are Jewish. 23% are Muslim, Druze, Christian, or others, and many choose to serve in the Israeli military too.', ""All part of the grand strategy. They are willing to expend as many lives as possible of their own children to win their political battles. They know that their allies in the west don't care about Jewish children. It really is a very clever strategy. And it keeps working."", 'Many Palestinians think that kidnapping Israeli children and massacring innocent Israeli civilians is justified because their hatred of Israel has overtaken any kind of rational thinking. They hate Israelis so much that they will justify anything, even keeping innocent children hostage in Gaza. \n\nThe Palestinians are driven not by grievances over land but rather by genocidal hatred of Jews. That’s why they haven’t turned against Hamas, whose charter says they want to kill Jews and reject any Jewish state, and why there aren’t Palestinians protesting around the world against Hamas’ massacres of Jews. \n\nBlind hatred has made Palestinians turn a blind eye to even the worst atrocities, since they are perceived as acts of “decolonization” and “resistance”, and the ideology of many Palestinians is similar to the ideology of ISIS supporters, in terms of how willing they are to accept deliberate attacks on civilians.', '>Palestine started the war. and now they are crying?\n\nPalestinian nationalism in a nutshell.', 'https://preview.redd.it/6hd0yrqc9kub1.jpeg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3fed6c9afe45542d284cb50edbf232a725297b9', ""Perhaps Palestinians want a peaceful resolution, maybe, but they're not willing to own to their historical mistake of getting addicted to terrorism many decades ago.\n\nIsrael proved time and again that it was willing to pursue peace with its neighbors, and it even gave up significant amount of land - the Sinai peninsula handed back to Egypt in 1979 is bigger than all of Israel. Even with the Palestinians, Israel dismantled its illegal settlements in the Gaza Strip and pulled out.\n\nPalestinians are not willing to put down their weapons and stop their attempts to murder Jews. Their western supporters think a peace agreement is just something that can happen instantly if Israel would just agree to it.\n\nThe sad reality is that it'll take many many years of non-violence by the Palestinians before Israel will take any further chance on the peace process, in fear of their security. And like an addict that keeps going back, I don't think the Palestinians have the internal political strength, the will, and culture to stop."", 'Wait you mean they lose and then whine? \nOkay everyone act surprised….or not', 'Stop grouping people into a single category.

Israel won the war in 1948, that is a fact. Mind you with 6 different countries as opponents by the way. Since they won, they get to decide their borders. 

Now if you look at it from a theoretical, do you actually think that the Arabs would just let the Jews, both local and migrants, stay in the territory? I'm betting no, but we won't know for sure. If they were as religious as they are right now, all the Jews would have probably been massacred though, I know that for sure.

In 637AD, Jerusalem was a Christian city and had been for hundreds of years.  Muslims conquered it in 638AD, but the Jews remained.  The area changed hands a few times during the crusades, but ended up in the hands of Saladin.  Fearing the return of the crusaders, the Muslims destroyed coastal cities and filled in harbors to prevent sea landings.  After the death of Saladin and the fall of the Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluk dynasty continued this policy, leading to the area becoming desolate and largely uninhabited by the late 15th century... but still the Jews remained.  After Spain kicked out the Muslims who had held the country for several hundred years, they banned both Jews and Muslims from the country.  This led many Spanish Jews to go to Israel (which under the Mamluks was part of Syria).  There are several contemporary accounts from travelers of the time regarding how unpopulated and how much of a wasteland the area was.  There were small populations in a few cities, but little else.\n\nInterestingly, the first significant migration of European Jews back to the area after the migration from Spain came under Sultan Selim II, in 1558, who encouraged Jews to move to the area.\n\nNapoleon conquered the area in 1799 and planned a Jewish state there, but the idea was shelved after his defeat at Acre.\n\nThere were a couple more attempts to create Jewish communities over the next century, mostly sidelined by Druze revolts.\n\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, European Jews began moving back to the area in numbers due to persecution in Europe.  The Jewish National Fund was established during this same period, to purchase land in Israel.  The fund purchased land from absentee Ottoman landlords, who thought they were putting one over on the Jews by selling them deserts and swamps.  The Jews promptly irrigated the deserts, drained the swamps, and built an economy.  To this day, the Jewish National Fund is the single largest landholder in Israel.\n\n**The land should belong to those who set up a country there.**\n\nAfter the Central Powers lost WWI and the Ottoman Empire was broken up, the League of Nations gave the UK the Mandate of Palestine with the purpose of setting up a Jewish homeland.  When the League of Nations was replaced by the UN, the UN voted to create a Jewish Homeland in the space, and a Palestinian homeland, via the partition plan.  The Jews accepted the agreement, all Arab nations voted against it, and the Arabs immediately began a civil war, so the plan was never implemented.  When the British Mandate ended, the Jews declared their own independent state, according to the UN's plan.  ...and all of their neighbors immediately declared war on them.\n\n**The land should belong to those who won it by conquest.**\n\nWhen all of Israel's neighbors declared war on them in 1948, the idea was to push the Jews into the sea.  It didn't work out that way.  The Arabs tried again in 1956, 1967, and 1973.  It did not go as they'd hoped."", 'If the Middle East countries had won the wars, they wouldn’t be talking about giving back the land or repatriating the Jews.
