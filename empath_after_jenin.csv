Any time a news story raises your eyebrow, ask yourself who the target audience is, and who buys advertising in that medium. Or, in the case of ad-free media, who funds the medium for street cred and/or tax deductions. No news source will bite the hand that feeds it.

It's not a question of ""just take the IDF's word for it,"" in most of these cases the organization in question *are claiming responsibility* for their fighters' actions, and *identifying them as their fighters'.* 

It's frustrating that you need to actually go to Arab media to get things like:

> And the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade — an armed militia affiliated with Fatah, the secular political party that controls the Palestinian Authority, claimed one of the dead, Izz al-Din Salahat, as a fighter.
