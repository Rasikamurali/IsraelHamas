> If not, why do you think they entered Jenin at all?

As far as I understand it the IDF entered the refugee camp in the first place to raid a PIJ cell operating out of there, I've seen some people say that there's 'video evidence' of this, so if someone has that (or any other form of evidence that I couldn't find) and could link it that would be great. 

I didn't look into the clashes in detail at all but I seriously doubt the IDF just waltzed in there to kill Palestinians for no reason and leave, there seems to have been an actual military target there and the Palestinians in the camp attempting to secure it were armed and were firing which eventually lead to at least one civilian getting killed in the crossfire. If any of this is wrong I'd like to be corrected but based on this I wouldn't say this specific operation was meant to terrorize Palestinians like you were talking about (even though many other Israeli policies/operations in the West Bank are) or that this should be compared to a mass shooter killing civilians at their place of worship. 

In essence there are a lot of things that are wrong with Israel's administration of the West bank and it's treatment of Palestinians there but this specific operation in question should not be compared to the hate crime in Jerusalem. They're certainly connected but not on the same level or equivalent at all really. Largely because one included the deliberate targeting of civilians and the other (as far as I can tell) did not.",2023-01-28 16:54:34
