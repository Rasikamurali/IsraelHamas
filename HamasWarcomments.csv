Absolutely gutting to read. Motaz’s is also incredibly gut wrenching.,2023-12-02 17:20:36
"I saw a journalist ismail hood and his last message on Instagram as well. The bombardment is so bad after the truce and today, nobody understands how severe it is especially now a lot of journalists are saying their last/ goodbye messages.",2023-12-02 17:41:11
I can’t even fathom being an activist and then losing all hope and feeling like the shadow of death is cast right at your feet. Her face looks transformed from when we first started seeing her.,2023-12-02 17:45:30
"Open the photos to expand them further and read her full caption. 

I'm at a loss for words to describe how sad, upset, and horrified I feel. It's clear no goverment, no nation, has the courage to step in and intervene. Only the Creator can save them now.",2023-12-02 17:10:25
"I have been forced to watch this once courageous, idealistic & creative woman be mentally & physically broken bit by bit by bit.

Let's just say, I won't be forgetting or forgiving either, and if my future nieces & nephews or any other ppl of future generations ask me what happened in '23, I will tell them that every evil deed you could possibly think of has been done to these innocent people by Israel while our sycophant leaders kept giving them money.",2023-12-02 18:19:04
"These are the real journalists,real hero’s who report the truth. Better than very single puppet msm western journalists put together.",2023-12-02 17:44:41
Bisan looks so tired compared to when she first started posting. I can’t even imagine how hard it is for her. Praying for her.,2023-12-02 17:59:55
This girl is so sweet. I’m going to cry my eyes out if anything happens to her.,2023-12-02 18:07:39
Stay strong. The world is watching.,2023-12-02 17:59:12
The part of not being able to differentiate between reality and your nightmares. What a fucking depraved atrocity to be in,2023-12-02 19:08:20
I suspected Israel’s revenge would be brutal and still i am surprised for the level of brutality. Genocide Joe gave them bunker-buster bombs to use in high populated areas and then called for restraint? We are not Israelis; we are not easily fooled. Genocide Joe and the US are complicit in the genocide of Gaza. We have to demand justice. Please write to the ICC and make your voice heard,2023-12-02 18:48:41
So many of them posted something like this. I am heartbroken. I will not be well if any more of them are harmed.,2023-12-02 19:09:39
"My heart hurts. I’ve been extra worried since I saw she caught a respiratory illness… covid never went away, illnesses are rampant, and they don’t even have water or shelter, let alone medicines or hospitals.",2023-12-02 19:35:48
"I don’t think they understand how many people have a relationship, a true bond, with Bisan and other citizen journalists sharing their stories. Bisan is like my friend, wallah; I don’t know how it’s possible to love someone you’ve never met and identify with them so much. Plestia too, when I saw in one of her stories that she watched Korean dramas, I cried; she is just like me, I thought. I already knew, but since she was only sharing war footage, I saw a different side of her. I already identified with them, but these types of things make you remember they are no different, and their lives aren’t exceptional; they enjoyed everything we enjoy. They just have been put in this miserable situation. Millions love her, and they are deeply affected by her suffering. Israel and America will never be forgiven for what they’re doing, and we will never lose hope. Palestine will be free, and the oppressors will pay a heavy, heavy price.",2023-12-02 19:40:57
My heart hurts so much. Nothing feels happy right now knowing what they are all going thru. Oh Allah help them all.,2023-12-02 19:19:46
Her posts broke my heart. This is all too much. It needs to end.,2023-12-02 19:51:14

I hope it stops. Nobody should live or even die like this. 💔💔💔💔,2023-12-02 18:56:46
The fact that my country is sending millions and millions of dollars to assist in the genocide of the Palestinian people is one of the most disturbing and depressing things I’ve experienced in my lifetime. Seeing this evil destruction makes my heart sink every day. I am so sorry.,2023-12-02 21:44:15
"Heartbreaking, Israel genocide will not be forgotten, and neither will the memories of these incredible Palestinians.",2023-12-02 21:51:11
"It's time for people, not governments, to make a stand.",2023-12-02 19:12:12
"I check Motaz, Bisan, Plestia, Yara and other brave journalists every morning. I'm literally terrified if anything happens to them. I can't stand this madness 😭 I can't do anything, I'm just crying all days long, exploring Palestinian history and discovering thousands of israeli lies and crimes. It's astonishing that this criminal enclave is even existing today.",2023-12-02 20:55:26
"It will take about 2.3 million Gazans to be killed or ethnically cleansed through their own trail of blood, body parts, and tears, before the war ends and the west is satisfied.

For the western standpoint, dehumanization, ethnic cleansing, and genocide is fully embraced for human rights and to be against all forms of racial injustices.

What matters is to lie, use double standards, hypocrisy, spends millions on propaganda (it probably comes from American taxpayer money which will then be used to brainwash them back), and also bombing the remaining hostages to free them.

The role of turning from a victim of the holocaust to an abuser is complete as the last vestiges of mortality is effectively purged and destroyed in a self-mutilation.   Soon they will be joining the ranks of the west who effectively wiped out indigenous nations in the millions and did nothing to compensate them beyond stealing.  Only the richest rule and they are allowed to break all the rules, since might is my right and rules for thee are not for me.  They are allowed to do whatever they want and will just settle with their millions.  Nothing is learned.

The whole ideology beyond being Orwellian has gone upside down.  What gets lost is the soul of the west and its full plunge into darkness, which will likely take another decade to be fully realized.  Perhaps less.",2023-12-03 00:10:09
This is sad 😔,2023-12-02 18:40:20
"I am at a loss for words at how disappointed I am with every world government and the Israeli INTENSE media bias. This post is absolutely heartbreaking, my heart is 100% with them and everybody who is suffering. The rampant genocide of the Palestinian people is on their hands, and they’ll never be able to wash it clean. I hope it haunts them.",2023-12-03 02:16:49
Devastating,2023-12-02 19:53:38
"It's almost impossible not to form parasocial relationships with people whose testimonies we've come to rely on but what a huge burden for them to carry.

These (bisan, motaz, palestia, eid, and other nakes ai can't think of at the top of my head) are young adults barely out of childhood, and they're carrying the weight of a people on their shoulders because so few media outlets are doing their job and telling the truth of what's happening.",2023-12-02 22:21:45
"She's such an amazing women, her coverage has been impeccable and there are few people I have so much respect for. I hope she makes it. It's all just so fucking sad to see. I don't know what to say",2023-12-02 23:17:53
"Off-tangent but I watched the movie [Lion of the Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_of_the_Desert) recently and I can't help but feel like relating it to Palestine. One line that hits the most from Omar Mukhtar was that the occupation can kill him but next generation will come and after that the next generation will come. I pray to Allah SWT for victory for Palestine, both in this dunya and jannah.",2023-12-02 20:50:20
We bare witness! We feel helpless.,2023-12-02 23:37:41
My brain can't comprehend how this is possible and how Israel is being allowed to literally annihilate a nation. My heart is broken into a million pieces.,2023-12-02 23:48:54
We need to do more. Protesting is nit going to to stop this,2023-12-03 03:15:40
Love you girl 🫶🏻,2023-12-02 20:03:35
Motaz posted something similar. They are surrounded by tanks. I'm so scared for them.,2023-12-03 04:31:09
I haven't prayed in a really long time but I've been praying for the people of Gaza.🥺 Today feels so heavy,2023-12-02 21:57:21
"True hero. She has inspired me. We will not go back. Something has awoken in us all.

From the river to the sea 🇵🇸",2023-12-03 00:18:15
"I cannot imagine how hopeless they must be feeling. They seem like completely different people they were on October 7th. To see such fiercely defiant, unapologetically loud and absolutely fearless journalists such as Bisan and Motaz speak this way is heartbreaking. 

Palestinian journalists are the only ones throughout this ordeal that deserve the utmost respect. They’ve shown what real journalism actually is, not like the Western puppets whose morals can be bought in a second.

We will never forget how the world abandoned Palestine. We will never forget a single person who allowed this to happen.",2023-12-03 07:48:16
It’s heartbreaking to read,2023-12-02 23:10:48
Absolutely heartbreaking.,2023-12-03 06:17:13
"My heart is aching for the Palestinian people. I feel so connected to Bisan, I can’t begin to imagine not seeing her sweet face anymore. I will never stop talking about Palestine, I will never stop thinking about these wonderful people. I love you Bisan! I love you Palestine, you will be free 🇵🇸",2023-12-02 20:52:56
The rage in my heart cannot be calmed except by the dismantling of the apartheid state. Disgusting.,2023-12-02 21:31:56

"Sadly most of humanity, or lack thereof, should be deeply ashamed of tolerating and cheering on a televised genocide. There will be a severe price to pay. For those few who protested and resisted, hopefully you'll get your reward for your humanity, in this world or the next.",2023-12-03 14:06:16
"I'm now just starting to recover from the flu and secondary bronchitis and all I could think while at the ER the other day was how lucky I was to not be bombed.  I can't imagine living in Palestine with even a slight cough let alone the flu, COPD, cancer, an amputation knowing that my odds of dying were imminent.  I said as much to my doctor, and his response was, that's what terrorists get.. then he saw my Palestinian flag on my bottle and completely froze and left the room...only to act cowardly and have the nurse talk to me the rest of the time there.",2023-12-03 16:26:04
"This girl, in the channel of language interchange she used to collaborate, was full of life. I just cannot grasp reality of this world. When i was younger I believe humanity was in another era of spiritual and social evolution, i used to look at ww2 like an ancient tale and something western society never would allow again... I was so naive.",2023-12-03 18:33:54
"My heart aches each time I go to see if Bisan, Motaz, Hind, or any of the brave journalists have posted a story. To see if they’re still there. To listen and learn from them. I wish that crying out could reach someone. Wishing comfort for them as I lay in bed at night. Bisan, we want you to live. I want to tell her, don’t give up hope… survive… but this is not reality that the Palestinian people are living in. I don’t know what to do but watch, and pray.",2023-12-03 18:41:44
"the fact that 57 days have passed, and nothing has been done to truly save and free these people is heart wrenching. we as humans have failed them.",2023-12-03 21:10:31

"As someone who was not previously informed enough and is trying to educate myself on this situation as much as I can, I cannot even begin to express how grateful I am towards journalists like Bisan, Eldin, Motaz, and Plestia (would love to know about more of such people) for helping the truth find its way to the rest of the world amidst the dehumanization being perpetrated by the mainstream media. It’s just so heartbreaking to see someone as strong and inspiring as her lose hope. The world is a shitty place.",2023-12-03 03:08:40

"nothing to say 😢

she is absolutely right 10000000000%

i'm guilty, i've done nothing, even the protest and my unconditional support to Palestine is NOTHING.  
When i see Israeli from ALL over the world go to slaughter and kill my brothers and sisters, and I'm here, not allowed to cross the borders, that disgust me, feeling helpless.

I ask you to forgive me young lady, i ask my dear brothers and sisters of Palestine to forgive me.

my only support is the protest, boycotting, raising awareness toward this genocide, sending money

I ask Allah to forgive me for being helpless.  
I'm crying writing this

"Why TF can't Canada take a hard stance , why is the world not shutting this down...

I think there was some poll that said something like 95% of the world I'd behind Palestine rn...


And I get it like America has a lot of military power and money, but this has to stop...

I have family in Lebanon as well, and it's just feeling so bad like maybe it will be no more Gaza !

Americans,  you guys need to start a revolution..cause chaos. Our protesting isn't doing enough, israhell are zionist terrorists I'm so angry.",2023-12-03 15:46:18

"As a Jewish woman, I'm disgusted with the actions of Israel/my family and what seems like a world wide coverup of a genocide that is constantly unfolding.

Watching activists and journalists lose hope in real time has been devastating.",2023-12-03 17:44:28
"“Only the creator can save them now” is all too often the abdication of a responsibility that Allah gave us in the first place. Allah will not change the fate of a people until they change what is within them. 

If no government and no nation is intervening, that doesn’t mean to sit by passively. We cannot expect Allah to take care of everything without us doing our duty. We must do absolutely everything we can do to move these governments and nations, as is our obligation. 

Anything less is hopelessness, and cannot be entertained. Remember that if you are planting a seed and the hour is called, you must finish planting!

Showing up at newrooms, meta headquarters and where newspapers are published to riot or protest. 

Hijack those tv screens playing ad of celebs (I'm talking about those big screens in places such as NYC) and play live streams of Israel's attacks on Palestinians or  all the graphic deaths/injuries of Palestinians. 

Start digging up dirt on all the corrupted government and publish it to the public. 

Last one is, all of us should train to get strong. Start anyways, there may be a time where we might have to go head to head with the police and/or army and if not then at least we can protect ourselves from angry zionist on the streets since they've been Violent.",2023-12-02 22:40:13

"I was taught this as well, growing up. My parents were always very critical of Israel. Thankfully, my neighbourhood growing up had many people with the same opinion, but where I am now, it's the complete opposite. I've had old friends cut me off for openly showing support to Palestine.    

But as you say, I know I was brought up the right way and I won't change my stance on this. This has just confirmed it a thousand times more. One day, I hope the truth of this genocide will be accepted, that Zionism will be condemned like it should be, and that the people responsible for this will get their punishment. I will definitely never forget this.",2023-12-03 05:11:20
"My family is partially ""from"" Israel and my mother lived there for some time on a Kibbutz.  I've been there several times, including Birthright, which was the turning point when I saw exactly how much that trip is designed to brainwash you towards Zionism and how Palestinians were treated as third class citizens.  

The trip, which was really beautifully designed-everything from going to the desert to partying at a hotel with the other groups-had Israelis casually laughing about the shooting of a Palestinian farmer who had stolen a chicken to feed his family.  Whenever anyone in our group asked about some of the things we were reading, we got shut down.  

It's after this that I realized how completely brainwashed I'd been growing up and also how far this kind of progranda will go.  There's no other country in the world that will allow anyone who identifies as a religion to go on a 10-14 day free trip because they want them to move to that country.

And everyone is dead right. If you say anything against Israel, you're told you've been brainwashed by media, which is a joke, because all of the coverage in NYC is on Hamas and 10/7/23.  It's only social media where I've seen the actual damage consistently.",2023-12-03 17:54:09
"I'm a Black American and I'd go a step further to argue that many *white Americans are easily fooled. Black, brown & other marginalized people are FORCED to confront the everyday lies, stereotypes, racist ideologies, & systematic prejudices that negatively impact our lives on a daily basis. I'm not here trying to pretend all marginalized people are knowledgeable in international affairs, but, we do understand that America will stop at nothing to dehumanize entire demographics/countries of people. 

It's also why people like Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Angela Davis, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill, etc, dedicated their lives to not only speaking on domestic racism, but have talked about how this racism is weaponized to negatively influence how many Americans view/look down on people living in other countries. As a colonized people ourselves, most of us are disgusted with Israel & Zionist terrorists and are doing what we can to speak out against it. I've also seen many Black people claim they won't be voting for Biden - or anyone supporting this genocide again - and frankly in many states, the Black vote can make or break a candidate. We are OUTRAGED at what's happening to Palestinians (& everyone in the West Bank, Congo, Sudan, etc) and part of this is because we have felt the long-term, harmful consequences of colonization and white supremacy for our entire lives.",2023-12-02 19:34:33

"I agree, but I also don't know if they are easily fooled so much as they can more easily ignore what they believe doesn't affect them so long as they are comfortable

to borrow a phrase, it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his comfort depends on his not understanding it

the less comfortable people are in general, across demographics, the less likely they are to believe propaganda and support the status quo

it might be that young people on average are more sympathetic because they are less racist, but it's also because they are less comfortable and have already become skeptical of the narratives being sold by governments which they can clearly see have abandoned them

when you are familiar with suffering or expect it ahead, it is easier to express solidarity with those suffering elsewhere right now",2023-12-03 03:46:06

and obviously, i know some people of color who are ignorant or don’t care. but it’s disproportionate. out of all the white people i’ve been friends with or close to, i think maybe one has had the same type of understanding of the world as i have, and maybe two others have genuinely listened to what i’ve said.

## Kill authorizations

*Main article:* [*Disposition Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix)

A secret National Security Council panel pursues the killing of an individual, including American citizens, who has been called a suspected terrorist.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14) In this case, no public record of this decision or any operation to kill the suspect will be made available.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14) The panel's actions are justified by ""two principal legal theories"": They ""were permitted by Congress when it [authorized the use of military forces against militants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists) in the wake of [the attacks of September 11, 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11); and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself.""[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14)

Homeland Security Advisor [John O. Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O._Brennan), who helped codify targeted killing criteria by creating the [Disposition Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix) database, has described the [Obama Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_Administration) targeted killing policy by stating that ""in order to ensure that our counterterrorism operations involving the use of lethal force are legal, ethical, and wise, President Obama has demanded that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards and processes"".[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-15)

Reuters reported that [Anwar al-Awlaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki), an American citizen, was on such a kill list and was killed accordingly.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14)

On February 4, 2013, NBC published a leaked Department of Justice [memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/020413_DOJ_White_Paper) providing a summary of the rationale used to justify targeted killing of US citizens who are senior operational leaders of Al-Qa'ida or associated forces.

New York City is one of the first cities to adopt these laws, due to 9/11 and they were enacted so as to assist in the prosecution of violent acts of terror. They are constitutionally illegal in every respect, but some US states have allowed this class of laws to get by because of the increase in terror acts and lone wolf mass shootings.

"Ditto- I usually don't share too much to the entire Internet, but I lived in Beit Sahour (near Bethlehem) in 2009 and traveled all across the West Bank (Hebron, Ramallah, Tulkarem, Nablus, Jenin, and to some smaller towns), traveled around Israel, and even managed to visit the Gaza Strip for a week through Rafah (up and down the Strip, to Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Gaza City).

The experience in Palestine was absolutely amazing, especially as an American Jew. Welcomed everywhere I went, people were genuinely friendly and willing to show us around their towns without expectation that we would pay them (the tour guide scam). So many fantastic family dinners, big spreads of food, great discussions. It was life-changing.

My most eye-opening experience was how pretty much every Palestinian would openly welcome Jews or even Israelis, but condemned the Zionist agenda that occupies Palestine. Even in Hebron when the Israeli forces started tear gassing and shooting and we all fled into a shop to hide, I was a bit shell-shocked and started to confuse Hebrew words into my Arabic, to the point where the shopkeeper obviously knew I was Hebrew-speaking when I used the Hebrew word for bread (""le5em"") instead of the Arabic word (""5ubez""- the Hebrew word meant ""meat"" even though I was trying to say ""bread""). The shopkeeper's eyes opened wide, he reached out and shook my hand, and said that anybody that would stand with Palestinians is welcome in his shop. The overwhelming amount of humanity and humility taught me lessons I'll never forget.

On the contrary, Israelis treated me great when they figured I was in their ethnic group. It changed a bit when they learned I was ethnically part-Arab. It changed a whole lot when they learned I did not agree with the occupation of Palestine, and that's when I nearly got shot...",2023-11-27 19:45:24

I don't really understand the US's unhealthy obsession with the Middle East. The best way forward is a series of active and passive protests by wearing Palestinian clothing and replacing conventional foods with Palestinian cuisines. Have open to the public documentary screening- something that the likes of Gal Gadot won't do. There is a drink in Bangladesh with the label ""I support Palestine"". Maybe local snacks, street food, drinks, etc. can have that. Even when this activity is localised within cities like Washington DC, NYC, LA and San Francisco, it has pretty big effects. Heck, even having posters like 'I can't believe I have to protest against genocide in 2023!' has a major effect.

"As an American, I continue to be deeply ashamed of my government's actions and political/monetary support of the Israeli government.  
 
As a great-grandchild of an Armenian refugee, I can't understand how my cries against an Israeli government, who denies the genocide of an entire branch of my ancestry, makes me antisemitic.  Because it doesn't.   The label only attempts to quiet me. If I can't condemn the extinction of a people without someone taking offense, then they need to look within themselves.

"Most Western media is owned and controlled by billionaire media moghouls that use their newspapers, radio and TV stations to promote their own worldview, which is generally an extreme right-wing capitalist one.

I don't even trust the BBC these days- their news and political departments are Conservative party biased, and their chairman is a political appointee.
Brexit was heavily promoted by these media moghouls and their winged monkeys and look how that turned out.

Elon Musk bought twitter to join the moghouls, but his tenure has become a standing joke except to his fans.

The moment I stepped in people just treated me quite poorly in the airport. I left my suitcase a couple feet away from me to see if my Palestinian driver was nearby and this Israeli guy yelled at me that I was blocking his entrance. Just very disgusting interaction. When my Palestinian driver came and helped me, he spoke to me on the car ride to my accommodation and he was so friendly and warm just asking me very basic questions that he found interesting. 

Then, when it was time to fly back to Europe, the treatment I received in Ben Gurion was so disgusting. One of the worst experiences of my life only because I taught in Palestine. I was fighting with the security lady because she was just so hateful, asking me why on earth would I teach in Palestine. They took me through every level of security with an insanely watchful eye. They went through my luggage and I believe intentionally left things open so that it spilled all over my clothes and damaged some of them. 

My students, though sometimes difficult to control were great. Curious and funny! They were middle schoolers, and they didn’t say anything antiseptic to me once. Literally just that Israelis wanted to kill them and they would die for Palestine.

I made a video about going through an IDF checkpoint. The first time I went through one I was so inflamed and angry just at the situation, that they treated us like dirt and had the nerve to have these weapons pointed at our car. We were at these psychopaths mercy.",2023-11-27 17:38:19

Being a moderate as an Israeli is the same as being an extremist anywhere else.

"The current political party in control of Israel ""LiKud""

It was founded by ""Menachem Begin"" also The leader of ""Irgun"" the terrorist organization. 

He specifically led this organization during the Deir Yassin massacre where they killed women and children.
 
He was also their leader during the bombing of the King David Hotel.

In 2005 Israel awarded convicted terrorists with certificates of appreciation to celebrate their involvement in bombing U.S owned businesses. 

Menachem Begins mentor was the founder of Irgun and the ""father"" of revisionist zionism. ""Ze'ev Jabotinsky""

He believed the only way forward was to establish a Jewish state by force. By any means necessary..

He also ""predicted"" the Holocaust in a speech made in 1938. (In 2023 a couple of zionists 'debunked' this speech but clearly you have to take the source into account ;p)

In 1939 the British enacted the MacDonald white paper 

""The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the Peel Commission's idea of partitioning Palestine. It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for five years and ruled that further immigration would then be determined by the Arab majority (section II). Jews were restricted from buying Arab land in all but 5% of the Mandate (section III)  



In response Janotonsky planned an attack with Irgun. He colluded the very anti-Semitic (sarcasm) polish government who began supplying arms and training to Irgun members.



The truth of the origin of these terrorists and their ideology should be taught to more people. If this was the case hopefully they wouldn't get away with saying stuff like this but I'm begging to believe it doesn't matter either way.",2023-12-01 14:30:18

It is a reminder that the resistance and seeking freedom had not stopped and that Palestinians are as capable as anyone else.  The inconvenience the Oct 7 created to plans to exploit Gaza’s resources, or better expose the plans, is an honorable thing that the resistance did!

"I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/185by20/comment/kb1hqzy/?) about 'narcissistic rage' a few days ago.  Beyond rage there is physical abuse, which I think this guy exemplifies.  He's actually admitting to and describing his own narcissistic abuse escalation and his mental progression, elsewhere too such as on his Instagram (thank you to the person who linked that).

Physical abuse is often discussed in terms of domestic abuse, but I personally believe that it crops up in many superior/subordinate situations.  It turns the victim into a subordinate, in what should be an equal footing relationship or, at the least, an equal human rights relationship.

I view Israel's military and settler behavior as ticking all these items.  This is especially *clear* with the bloodlust statements and behaviors that are becoming public recently, like this OP.  But, I think and infer that it's been the case for a very long time.

This link contains rather more than I've excerpted here.  I think it's valuable to read in whole, as it details how the progression of violence goes.

1. Intimidation … The narcissistic spouse becomes a bully …
2. Isolation … The narcissist substantially limits their spouses ability to escape especially in dangerous situations. …
3. Restraint … The narcissist will confine their spouse by blocking a doorway, grabbing when trying to leave, locking doors with no key, or tying the person up. This causes a feeling of entrapment or imprisonment without any way to escape. …
4. Aggression … Because the narcissist will blame their spouse for their violent behavior, they will not stop using force once it is started. They will instead find more reasons to justify their brutality.
5. Endangerment … The narcissist then realizes they are no longer commanding the same level of fear, so they escalate the attacks. Verbal threats of killing their spouse, family members or themselves are mixed with physical violence and use of weapons. …",2023-12-01 18:54:05

"Funny how an educated journalist can go so quickly from preaching how to be Jewish by doing good, to calling for the genocide of Palestinians. Also interesting to note how he would be dubbed a terrorist if you'd reverse the context as I did below. 

**Yoni Leviatan, Times of Israel journalist, date unknown:**

""How to be Jewish: Be good. The end."" 

**Yoni Leviatan, Times of Israel journalist, 1 December 2023 (original context):**

""""""To those who reply to me with pictures of the damage and destruction in Gaza as if this is supposed to be something that moves me, you should know how much I really, truly in my heart don't care. In fact, this is what the saying ""I couldn't care less"" was made for. 

When I see dead Gazans, I don't see dead Gazans – I see the dead Israelis who came before them. 

When I see suffering Gazans, I don't see suffering Gazans – I see the suffering Israelis being kept in dark dungeons underground. 

You see, Hamas's attack on October 7 was so successful that it blinded all of us to anything related to Gaza, Gazans or the troubles of either one. 

We only see blue and white now. 

And we are angrier than ever. Our blood is boiling hotter than ever. We care less about Gaza than ever. We care less about world opinion than ever. We want the @IDF to use more firepower than ever. 

But most of all, we want our people back more than ever – and will do whatever it takes. Literally, anything. Nothing's off the table. Mercy is a foreign concept that has no application here. The opposite – we want our army to attack with whatever the opposite of mercy is. 

We're more insistent than ever that the war will continue into southern Gaza until it reaches all the way to Qatar where the Mossad has formally been instructed to draw up plans for taking out the cowardly Hamas leaders hiding like little rats. 

And every day this war continues, our feelings get stronger. Our anger gets stronger. Our thirst for revenge gets stronger. Our willingness to cause massive damage without the slightest care in the world in our quest to free our people has already gotten so strong – and will continue to get stronger – that Gaza will long for the wars of past which will seem like a trip to Disney in comparison. 

But most of all, we're more insistent than ever that Palestinians will never have a state anywhere near our borders. Those dreams died along with our people on October 7. 

There is a time for peace and a time for war. I strongly suggest to all the well-meaning diplomats who keep trying to pressure Israel into peace with the Palestinians to save their energies and focus their efforts elsewhere where they have a chance of success. 

Because now is a time for war. All-out war. War without mercy.

"The “Jewish question” entered into the spotlight in the late 1800s, when pogroms against Jews in what is now Poland, Belarus, and Lithuania — previously a region of relative tolerance towards Jews in Europe — reached unsustainable levels. After being expelled from 10+ European countries, not allowed to own land, suffering a history of deadly violent persecution from Portugal to Russia, and never being seen or treated as “natives” anywhere in Europe, it became clear to Jews that they had no future in Europe. It was a matter of time before antisemitism became eliminationist. Such was the impetus behind the 1904 Balfour declaration…East Africa was considered, but the British wanted influence against French-influenced Lebanon, so they decided (in agreement with Jewish religious and historical connection to the Levant) to put forth the roots to a Jewish state in the Levant instead.

"What was the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising? What was the Easter Rising? What was the Battle of Wabash River? They were all *resistance.*

October 7th was a revolt against an oppressive power that has stolen the homes and land of Palestinian families and forced the surviving citizens of Palestine to live in ""the world largest concentration camp"". A power that commits war crimes and crimes against humanity in doing so, and has for nearly 20 years now (this after ~55 years of mistreatment already on the record). A power that has habitually ""mown the lawn"" that is Gaza (read: murdered civilians unprovoked), broken ceasefires brokered by members of Hamas, and assassinated people making real effort to broker long-term peace.

And before somebody cries, ""but they took hostages!"" Take a long, hard, *real* look at the people being released by Israel in exchange for Hamas hostages. What were their crimes? Why were they imprisoned? Why were they tortured and beaten? Were any of them given a fair trial, and sentenced? No. They weren't. They sound like hostages to me, and some of them had been kept from their families for *years.* They were snatched off the streets and from their homes, all because they're the ""wrong"" colour, the ""wrong"" religion, the ""wrong"" race. Most of them were children. Think about that, really *think* about that.

People call it a terrorist attack, they are wrong. Wrong or lying. It was an act of revolution no different than the world has seen before in countless other oppressive, murderous, corrupt, racist, and apartheid regimes.

"I have never really cared about international issues and while I sort of knew that Israel and Palestine did not get along, whenever I saw people protesting with ""free Palestine"" I just thought they were a bunch of tofu eating, chardonnay quaffing hippies looking for something to whine about so never really ever looked into it.

When Hamas attacked Israel with such vengeance I decided to find out why there was so much hate. Now I do not care what side anyone is on, those were crimes against innocent people and of course I was repulsed by what happened and still am. I hope the people responsible are held to account.

What has horrified me to the point of it having me question my whole belief system on the western powers being the good guys is currently being shattered. Most people are in total support of Israel doing what they are doing and justifying the death of ordinary people who have nothing to do with the attack last week.

It is like if I show compassion to innocent people being murdered somehow it means I am a Hamas sympathizer or something.

Having read what Israel has done at least in the last 15 years which is horrific, then you add on they had to be told by the US to turn on drinking water and there is a continual string of ""accidents"" for all the murders going on as well as denial of food and medicine, I am just so ashamed that my country and most of its inhabitants are OK with killing innocent people as long as it is the ""right innocent people""

How can people not see all the killing and not be horrified by it?

As usual, innocent  civilians, especially palestinians bear the brunt of the actions of fanatical leadership.  
How easy it is to say palestinians deserve sovereignty and freedom, but realistically how can the Israelis allow the nation of palestine to have a standing army and control over their airspace? Any treaty demands trust on both sides.  How the hell does either side trust the other given their history of broken promises on both sides? 

politics can be manipulated to resolve civil issues, but at the heart of this age old clusterfuck is Allah vs Yahweh, and the fanatics on both sides don't want to give an inch because each believes their version of the big guy in the sky is the only truth.",2023-10-17 16:24:40

"The more information I read about this atrocity the more odd it becomes as it is being reported by media outlets. While the hospital has been damaged during the fighting,  it is being reported that this was a rocket fired by a Hamas soldiers (I am no longer using the term militant because Palestine is a country and soldiers fight for a country) and the rocket was mis guided and landed in the the courtyard. I find it strange that this rocket which was also claimed to have had some sort of malfunction as some ""experts"" have put it, managed to strike the exact area innocent people were taking shelter resulting in their deaths. Many media outlets are also saying that palestinian officials are also inflating this number. I find this hard to believe because of the concentration of people in the area.    For something portrayed as a bumbling miss fire (this is how it reads to me) it sure did find it's way to a sensitive target and MISS the Anglican run hospital almost entirely. The IDF says hospitals are not targets and that even the crater is too small for them and their weapons. Really? The IDF has access to a multitude of high tech weapons, even nuclear weapons but not rockets. Does this mean they do not have anything that could have caused this damage?

[And here's another one going around](https://twitter.com/Omarfsa2/status/1714349451651719581)

[Video from a Palestinian source](https://twitter.com/qudsn/status/1714335703117570261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1714335703117570261%7Ctwgr%5E5be5a528cd900e7392a1d90cce60cf8f8f60dbce%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesofisrael.com%2Fliveblog_entry%2Fisrael-publishes-video-it-says-proves-failed-rocket-launch-caused-gaza-hospital-blast%2F)

I think the best way to debunk it, if it is false, would be to cross-check the videos to see if the explosions line up or something. At the moment, but to remain skeptical of both sides in my opinion, although I think it's more likely this was an Israeli airstrike rather than one of Hamas' rockets malfunctioning.

As for the videos I sent, I noticed that some stuff doesn't really line up. There's three videos posted. The videos all have conflicting time stamps. The one in the bottom right says it was filmed on the 18th of October which isn't possible at all, so I think the timestamps may have been tampered with.

However, if it is true that Hamas stores munitions in hospitals(which definitely is possible) then it wouldn't be far fetched for this to be a rocket malfunction hitting the munitions storage.

Update: Official Israel Twitter account [edited their post](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-publishes-video-it-says-proves-failed-rocket-launch-caused-gaza-hospital-blast/) to remove the video once people pointed out the inconsistencies in the timing.",2023-10-17 17:02:11

There probably wasn’t a single target in the entire area that would’ve killed more people, and yet people think it was an accident.

Not sure. Because on the other hand, although (so far) it looks like it's been an unfortunate accident (I've seen some live cam footage, unedited.

Look at the combatants to civilian death ratio. It's not even comparable. The overwhelming majority of people killed in Ukraine are soldiers, on both sides. The overwhelming majority of people getting killed in Gaza, and in all of the various major operations Israel has had in Gaza (where more than a few hundred have died) have been civilians. Every time. There's no comparison.

However illegal the invasion of Ukraine was, and hower cruel it is, and all of the war crimes that have been committed, you cannot deny that it is being faught far more humanely than whatever Israel is doing against Palestinians. Neither Ukraine nor Russia dehumanize their victims the way Israel does.

">What the actual fuck. There are cities in Ukraine that no longer exist becasue the russian destroyed them.

Yes, and said cities are evacuated, and certainly allowed it, before it becomes the war zone they are, and destroyed to pieces, like Bakhmut. Which is why civilian casualties are extremely low compared to military casualties. The preliminary numbers are there and you can look it up, if you don't believe me.

Compare those numbers to Gaza, which Israel has turned into a concentration camp, where nobody or nothing can come and leave except under Israeli supervision, since 2006. They tell people to evacuate a city, when they have it completely boxed in, an area that has among the highest population densities in the world. And despite Israel having access to far more advanced precision-weapons than Ukraine and Russia, they still fire indiscriminately upon civilian areas, and often on civilians where no military target were present; that much has been documented time and time again by reports from human rights organizations over the years. Look at UN report for the 2018 protests, or Amnesty reports for the Gazay war in 2008 and 2014 as an example. Israel purposefully targets civilians and/or indiscriminately fires on civilian areas. Israel's claims of human shields are also refuted in almost every instance (incidentally, Amnesty found a pattern of the Ukrainian army occupuing civilian areas, including schools and hospitals, without evacuating civilians from those areas).

The number of civilians, even children alone, who die compared to combatants, is disgusting. The former make up the overwhelming majority. They did in 2008. They did in 2014. And preliminary numbers, although this war has just ""begun"", has already civilians as an overwhelming majority of casualties in Gaza. 

There's simply no comparison, in combatant/civilian death ratio, to Ukraine/Russia. The latter, despite its far greater intensity, is being fought far more humanely. 

>Don't you fucking dare attempt to deny the genocide the russians are commiting.

It's not genocide. Stop ruining that word, please. It was first used to describe what the Nazis were doing to Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, etc., which was the targeted attempt at wiping out entire peoples through mass killings. Is Israel doing it in Gaza? No. Is Russia doing this in Ukraine? Not even close. 

People often conflate ethnic cleansing or masscares with genocide. These things are not the same thing. What happened to the Native Americans in the 1500s-1900 was genocide. Guetemalan Indians in the 1950s was genocide. What Turkey was doing to Armenians in the 1910s was genocide.

You use the term ""genocide"" like you do and it completely looses its meaning.",2023-10-17 17:38:54

“What are the facts, and what is the truth that the facts bear out?”

The facts thus far from multiple expert observers indicate that, no, it was most likely NOT an Israeli air strike, but rather a relatively low yield rocket consistent with what Hamas has used against Israel for many years.

"Assumption about the attack on the hospital

I'm thinking that the attack on the hospital was carried out by Israel as a warning, in the sense that in the previous days the hospital had already been warned with attacks to make those inside leave the hospital (with `only` 4 injured ), but no one left the hospital. So yesterday they sent in a warning airstrike increasing the firepower (that's why there is no crater). And from here it got out of hand because news started coming out about hundreds of deaths, and from there they had to deny that it was them because they had no way of having `real` news on the situation, because the first news/video on the situation occurred the next morning.
So they have to stay with their position.

I don't know if I missed some information, if they let me know.

Most of the damage at the scene appeared to have been caused by fire, which  would be consistent ""with a rocket that had a lot of fuel and propellant in it"".

Till you answer let’s do some math “ I really love math “ 10000 and counting rockets were fired towards Israel since the 7th of October , only one misfires , and man oh man it hit the one place Israel’s been threatening for a week , the odds of that happening are more or less likely to happen than Israel doing it ? 
The munition and level of destruction of that missile being able to kill almost 800 ppl at once , now does this sound like a weapon Islamic jihad has ? “ they are far weaker than Hamas “ , assuming so , would Israel still exist if Gaza militants had such a weapon ?",2023-10-18 13:45:27

Misfired rockets have hit places in Gaza. How is it that you don't know this? Gaza has been hit by both Israeli and Hamas and IJ missiles every day since the latest outburst of violence. Again, how is it that you aren't aware of something this basic and undisputed? Either side would be simply insane to deny this. 

It hit somewhere Israel had ordered to evacuate because Israel has ordered evacuation of the entirety of Northern Gaza (a war crime). So it's not a big coincidence at all. Failed Gazan rockets are statistically bound to hit places that have been ordered to evacuate, as there are so many of both.

Many Jews said that jews never stayed in a land for more than 80 years and they believe their near is coming. Israel today has become the weakest since 75 years because finally the truth is coming out even thought they have strong supporters and all. 
And to answer the point when you said “i never saw a Palestinian denounce the actions of hamas” that’s because we know who they are and that they’re our only hope after God to achieve freedom from this evil occupation.

Israel was and still planning to move people out of gaza “temporarily” to fix and revive gaza and then bring them back.

So, of course at first I was like “Israel has a right to defend themselves and do what they need to do to protect themselves”, but then I started learning a bit about Palestine because I thought “there’s two sides to this” and I started to gain an appreciation and empathy for Palestine. 
I, right now, am still so confused about who is who and why they are doing what they are doing. 
My instant thought was “What is Israel doing? Why are they doing this to Palestine. This is awful” and I was getting upset that so many people were siding with Israel without question. 
Then you have the video footage of Hamas kidnapping people and reports of people being brutality murdered by Hamas. So then I get confused about who Hamas is, and why they are doing this… like how I understand it is that Israel has been slowly taking over Palestinian territory over the years? Which is awful. Idk how they could do this. 
So, Hamas is the gov’t party in power, and they’re voted in? If they are why would people vote for them? Are they being forced? Are they rigging elections? 
Then you see the bombings going on in Gaza and… it’s just so difficult to “choose a side” because at the end of the day I believe it’s leadership who are fucking over the civilians. Is this about religion? Land? Culture? Power? What is it. 
I have an understanding of what is happening, but the news makes it really difficult to get a grasp of the chaos that is happening. 
It’s heartbreaking, and I just want to make everything better. Because if there is anything I can understand is a group of ppl taking over your lands. They did that to us in Canada and now we have so many issues. It’s awful. 
I have no I’ll intentions behind my comments. I’m just giving you my honest opinion based on the information I can find that I think is reliable. 

I hold a space in my heart for you all that are suffering. I wish I could help and do more to stop the suffering.",2023-10-29 14:06:13

"As an American who has been an activist for Palestine liberation for at least 20 years, I am horrified and disgusted and heartbroken, especially because my taxes are paying for this terror. I know it’s not much, but I am so sorry that my country is playing such an active role in this genocide. 

What’s most disturbing to me is how much Palestinian voices and those of allies are being quashed in a country where we’re supposed to have a First Amendment. Goons will always find a way around. This is why much of the world is clueless about what is happening on the ground. 

If you’re in the States, or in a place where you’re relatively safe to express yourself, and have enough privilege to speak up and act, please please say something. Call your Congress members. Every day. I am represented by a conservative Democrat who’s a war hawk and doesn’t give a rat’s ass, but I still hold her accountable, in phone calls, emails, and in letters to the editor calling her out for her support for genocide. These only cost time. 

October 4 is a day of action and there’s likely a protest near you. Go to it. Show the world that we see what’s happening and we won’t be silenced. 

What’s most infuriating is how much those in solidarity with Palestine are actively being silenced in the guise of “antisemitism”, which is complete bullshit. We see you, Gaza. We’re just fighting like hell to make sure the world does too. 

If you’re Palestinian in the diaspora, please as much as you can, take care of yourselves, because your loved ones need you. Let us white privileged folks take the load off a little. Edit: I by no means mean this in a patronizing way, just that we caused this mess and we should bear the responsibility of making it right. 

Sheikh Jarrah, Beita, Huwwara, and especially Gaza, you are in my heart. Inshallah you will be free. ❤️

Edit: *November* 4 is a day of action.",2023-10-28 17:28:39

Meanwhile the PA has become an extension of the occupation and an enforcer of the settler colonial policies in Israel. 

Maybe my view is controversial but we are not helping ourselves in this situation. Hamas is not a group to be lionized and admired. Almost 10% of their fighter base are collaborators (which makes it even more shocking that Israel didn't know). Haniyeh has relatives/nephews who SERVED in the IDF. His sister is Israeli.

"The killing and persecution was an integral part of giving them a separate territory to begin with. The Europeans wanted them out of their territory and the Christians wanted their end of the world fantasy, but they didn't want to give up any of their own territories as restitution - they took from someone else the penance they paid to the Zionists. And the Zionists wanted power after they saw how much not having power made them defenseless against suffering, so they took that deal.

They end up abusing another vulnerable group. They end up thinking the world owe them for what they suffered. They repeat the cycle of violence because that's all they know.
Being amongst colonial Europe for so long these European Jews may have also unconsciously absorbed colonial perspectives & racism. They may see how successful the colonial powers were & still are. They don't want to suffer anymore, so they aspire to be the oppressors because it's either oppress or be oppressed in their PTSD deranged mind. They internalised that racism against non-white is acceptable, that non-white are subhuman, & therefore non-white lives don't matter to them.

Thankfully not all Jews are like that. Even some Holocaust survivors & ultra religious Jews are horrified by these genocidal Zionists. There are also leftist Jews who truly believe in universal human rights & are trying to speak out against Israeli atrocities. But they get smeared as anti-semitic self-hating Jews by these extreme racist Zionists who run the Israeli gov. These Zionists are terrorists who hijack the Jewish identity & in fact feeds anti-semitism by conflating Jewish identity with their own racist genocidal goal which are not very different from the Nazis & their Ayran ideals.",2023-10-28 06:35:20

I have heard many Israeli families of hostages say, no, not in my name, stop this, let them go, and I think they are right. But they’re not just out to get their family/friends back, they want peace for all. 

I suffered so you gotta too just… keeps it going and there’s no tripwire to break it. I can understand it via disability - I am and was bullied horribly growing up - but I wouldn’t dare visit that on someone else, because I know how it feels. 

If Israel is indeed doing this (we didn’t have power back then, so fuck you because we are in power now, let’s see how you like it - please excuse any ignorance displayed here, it’s not easy to understand WHY), they’re nothing but the same Nazi ideal bastards that hurt them!

Jews are not Nazis. Neither are Israel. But they’re using the same words and techniques (no communications in PAL, Nazis put Jews into ghettoes and sealed them off), and they are no better than those who ran/organised/agreed with the Holocaust if they do that. 

Do you understand what I’m trying to say? I am not Jewish, and Israelis, Jews, refugees deserve their homeland, of course. But they don’t deserve to take away another population’s rights to get them.

I do not know about Olivier, he is not in the picture so I prefer not to comment if I don't know.

All the other guys are what you can call ""performative liberals & activists"". They like to give an opinion when it's safe that they are 100% on the right side. Mocking and laughing about Trump and republican stupidity is a low hanging fruit because the jokes write themselves. 

But in this situation,  when you need to make an effort , they fall silent,  not only because i bet they don't know what the fuck they and how they are going say it, but also they have the media bosses censoring any opinions that doesn't fall to their agenda.

The only one that truly hurts for me is John Stuart,  I've been a fan of the guy because he always seems to see things the very same as me. Hopefully he comments soon or I will be very disappointed.

Jon Stewart is a different person. He sees both sides then sides with the civilians being affected and condemns the political theater going on that completely ignores their plight. He acknowledges what Israel has done over the last 60+ years even though he is Jewish. He also wants Palestinians to govern themselves independently from being used as cover.

Our Lord, we are ashamed of our inability to help our brothers in Palestine.

We are ashamed of our weakness, but Ya Rabbi, we have You, who owns all that exists.

Our Lord, you are our protector and helper.

Ya Rabbi, help our brothers in Palestine as you helped your Beloved on Bedr and as you helped us in Bosnia.

Ya Rabbi, our brothers are hungry, so feed them.

They are thirsty, so you give them water.

They are upset, so you calm them down.

They are weak, but they trust in You, Lord, so don't leave them.

Ya Rabbi, the oppressor in your blessed land, suffers, persecutes, kills them. 

O Lord, destroy the evildoer and the one who sows disorder on earth.

Lord, strike fear into their hearts, break their ranks and disable their weapons. 

Ya Rabbi, you are powerful and we are powerless so help them.

We are ashamed, Lord, of our weakness. Ya Rabbi, help them, unite their hearts in the fight on your path and give them victory.

These people, this Zionist scum truly are modern day National Socialists. And I don't say that just an insult; these people are extreme nationalists, they share many of the ideas that were once held by the Germans and Austrians (Lebensraum, this land belongs to us as a divine right). They are also extreme racists in the purest sense of the word; they believe they are superior, more moral and pure than others people, that the others are inherently violent, that the others do not deserve the same rights as they, that they are a lesser form of life.
In highschool I saw the propaganda movie the Eternal Jew. It shocked me to my core that such evil is possible. But in time I realized it wasn't in any way unique to the Germans people, that others were just as capable of it.
Of course, if I do call these Zionists mofos for what they really are I get threatened with a ban. Meanwhile, they are perfectly free to dehumanize all they want, to piss on their victims.
