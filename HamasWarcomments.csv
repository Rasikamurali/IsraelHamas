Absolutely gutting to read. Motaz‚Äôs is also incredibly gut wrenching.,2023-12-02 17:20:36
"I saw a journalist ismail hood and his last message on Instagram as well. The bombardment is so bad after the truce and today, nobody understands how severe it is especially now a lot of journalists are saying their last/ goodbye messages.",2023-12-02 17:41:11
I can‚Äôt even fathom being an activist and then losing all hope and feeling like the shadow of death is cast right at your feet. Her face looks transformed from when we first started seeing her.,2023-12-02 17:45:30
"Open the photos to expand them further and read her full caption.

"I have been forced to watch this once courageous, idealistic & creative woman be mentally & physically broken bit by bit by bit.

Let's just say, I won't be forgetting or forgiving either, and if my future nieces & nephews or any other ppl of future generations ask me what happened in '23, I will tell them that every evil deed you could possibly think of has been done to these innocent people by Israel while our sycophant leaders kept giving them money.",2023-12-02 18:19:04

Bisan looks so tired compared to when she first started posting. I can‚Äôt even imagine how hard it is for her. Praying for her.,2023-12-02 17:59:55

The part of not being able to differentiate between reality and your nightmares. What a fucking depraved atrocity to be in,2023-12-02 19:08:20
I suspected Israel‚Äôs revenge would be brutal and still i am surprised for the level of brutality. Genocide Joe gave them bunker-buster bombs to use in high populated areas and then called for restraint? We are not Israelis; we are not easily fooled. Genocide Joe and the US are complicit in the genocide of Gaza. We have to demand justice. Please write to the ICC and make your voice heard,2023-12-02 18:48:41
So many of them posted something like this. I am heartbroken. I will not be well if any more of them are harmed.,2023-12-02 19:09:39

"I don‚Äôt think they understand how many people have a relationship, a true bond, with Bisan and other citizen journalists sharing their stories. Bisan is like my friend, wallah; I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible to love someone you‚Äôve never met and identify with them so much. Plestia too, when I saw in one of her stories that she watched Korean dramas, I cried; she is just like me, I thought. I already knew, but since she was only sharing war footage, I saw a different side of her. I already identified with them, but these types of things make you remember they are no different, and their lives aren‚Äôt exceptional; they enjoyed everything we enjoy. They just have been put in this miserable situation. Millions love her, and they are deeply affected by her suffering. Israel and America will never be forgiven for what they‚Äôre doing, and we will never lose hope. Palestine will be free, and the oppressors will pay a heavy, heavy price.",2023-12-02 19:40:57
My heart hurts so much. Nothing feels happy right now knowing what they are all going thru. Oh Allah help them all.,2023-12-02 19:19:46

The fact that my country is sending millions and millions of dollars to assist in the genocide of the Palestinian people is one of the most disturbing and depressing things I‚Äôve experienced in my lifetime. Seeing this evil destruction makes my heart sink every day. I am so sorry.,2023-12-02 21:44:15
"Heartbreaking, Israel genocide will not be forgotten, and neither will the memories of these incredible Palestinians.",2023-12-02 21:51:11
"It's time for people, not governments, to make a stand.",2023-12-02 19:12:12
"I check Motaz, Bisan, Plestia, Yara and other brave journalists every morning. I'm literally terrified if anything happens to them. I can't stand this madness üò≠ I can't do anything, I'm just crying all days long, exploring Palestinian history and discovering thousands of israeli lies and crimes. It's astonishing that this criminal enclave is even existing today.",2023-12-02 20:55:26
"It will take about 2.3 million Gazans to be killed or ethnically cleansed through their own trail of blood, body parts, and tears, before the war ends and the west is satisfied.

For the western standpoint, dehumanization, ethnic cleansing, and genocide is fully embraced for human rights and to be against all forms of racial injustices.

What matters is to lie, use double standards, hypocrisy, spends millions on propaganda (it probably comes from American taxpayer money which will then be used to brainwash them back), and also bombing the remaining hostages to free them.

The role of turning from a victim of the holocaust to an abuser is complete as the last vestiges of mortality is effectively purged and destroyed in a self-mutilation.   Soon they will be joining the ranks of the west who effectively wiped out indigenous nations in the millions and did nothing to compensate them beyond stealing.  Only the richest rule and they are allowed to break all the rules, since might is my right and rules for thee are not for me.  They are allowed to do whatever they want and will just settle with their millions.  Nothing is learned.

The whole ideology beyond being Orwellian has gone upside down.  What gets lost is the soul of the west and its full plunge into darkness, which will likely take another decade to be fully realized.  Perhaps less.",2023-12-03 00:10:09

"I am at a loss for words at how disappointed I am with every world government and the Israeli INTENSE media bias. This post is absolutely heartbreaking, my heart is 100% with them and everybody who is suffering. The rampant genocide of the Palestinian people is on their hands, and they‚Äôll never be able to wash it clean. I hope it haunts them.",2023-12-03 02:16:49
Devastating,2023-12-02 19:53:38
"It's almost impossible not to form parasocial relationships with people whose testimonies we've come to rely on but what a huge burden for them to carry.

These (bisan, motaz, palestia, eid, and other nakes ai can't think of at the top of my head) are young adults barely out of childhood, and they're carrying the weight of a people on their shoulders because so few media outlets are doing their job and telling the truth of what's happening.",2023-12-02 22:21:45

"Off-tangent but I watched the movie [Lion of the Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_of_the_Desert) recently and I can't help but feel like relating it to Palestine. One line that hits the most from Omar Mukhtar was that the occupation can kill him but next generation will come and after that the next generation will come. I pray to Allah SWT for victory for Palestine, both in this dunya and jannah.",2023-12-02 20:50:20

"I cannot imagine how hopeless they must be feeling. They seem like completely different people they were on October 7th. To see such fiercely defiant, unapologetically loud and absolutely fearless journalists such as Bisan and Motaz speak this way is heartbreaking. 

Palestinian journalists are the only ones throughout this ordeal that deserve the utmost respect. They‚Äôve shown what real journalism actually is, not like the Western puppets whose morals can be bought in a second.

We will never forget how the world abandoned Palestine. We will never forget a single person who allowed this to happen.",2023-12-03 07:48:16

"I'm now just starting to recover from the flu and secondary bronchitis and all I could think while at the ER the other day was how lucky I was to not be bombed.  I can't imagine living in Palestine with even a slight cough let alone the flu, COPD, cancer, an amputation knowing that my odds of dying were imminent.  I said as much to my doctor, and his response was, that's what terrorists get.. then he saw my Palestinian flag on my bottle and completely froze and left the room...only to act cowardly and have the nurse talk to me the rest of the time there.",2023-12-03 16:26:04

"My heart aches each time I go to see if Bisan, Motaz, Hind, or any of the brave journalists have posted a story. To see if they‚Äôre still there. To listen and learn from them. I wish that crying out could reach someone. Wishing comfort for them as I lay in bed at night. Bisan, we want you to live. I want to tell her, don‚Äôt give up hope‚Ä¶ survive‚Ä¶ but this is not reality that the Palestinian people are living in. I don‚Äôt know what to do but watch, and pray.",2023-12-03 18:41:44

I ask you to forgive me young lady, i ask my dear brothers and sisters of Palestine to forgive me.

Showing up at newrooms, meta headquarters and where newspapers are published to riot or protest. 

Hijack those tv screens playing ad of celebs (I'm talking about those big screens in places such as NYC) and play live streams of Israel's attacks on Palestinians or  all the graphic deaths/injuries of Palestinians. 

Start digging up dirt on all the corrupted government and publish it to the public.

But as you say, I know I was brought up the right way and I won't change my stance on this. This has just confirmed it a thousand times more. One day, I hope the truth of this genocide will be accepted, that Zionism will be condemned like it should be, and that the people responsible for this will get their punishment.

"My family is partially ""from"" Israel and my mother lived there for some time on a Kibbutz.  I've been there several times, including Birthright, which was the turning point when I saw exactly how much that trip is designed to brainwash you towards Zionism and how Palestinians were treated as third class citizens.  

The trip, which was really beautifully designed-everything from going to the desert to partying at a hotel with the other groups-had Israelis casually laughing about the shooting of a Palestinian farmer who had stolen a chicken to feed his family.  Whenever anyone in our group asked about some of the things we were reading, we got shut down.  

It's after this that I realized how completely brainwashed I'd been growing up and also how far this kind of progranda will go.  There's no other country in the world that will allow anyone who identifies as a religion to go on a 10-14 day free trip because they want them to move to that country.

And everyone is dead right. If you say anything against Israel, you're told you've been brainwashed by media, which is a joke, because all of the coverage in NYC is on Hamas and 10/7/23.  It's only social media where I've seen the actual damage consistently.",2023-12-03 17:54:09

I'm not here trying to pretend all marginalized people are knowledgeable in international affairs, but, we do understand that America will stop at nothing to dehumanize entire demographics/countries of people. 

It's also why people like Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X., Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Angela Davis, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill, etc, dedicated their lives to not only speaking on domestic racism, but have talked about how this racism is weaponized to negatively influence how many Americans view/look down on people living in other countries. As a colonized people ourselves, most of us are disgusted with Israel & Zionist terrorists and are doing what we can to speak out against it. I've also seen many Black people claim they won't be voting for Biden - or anyone supporting this genocide again - and frankly in many states, the Black vote can make or break a candidate. We are OUTRAGED at what's happening to Palestinians (& everyone in the West Bank, Congo, Sudan, etc) and part of this is because we have felt the long-term, harmful consequences of colonization and white supremacy for our entire lives.",2023-12-02 19:34:33

to borrow a phrase, it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his comfort depends on his not understanding it

the less comfortable people are in general, across demographics, the less likely they are to believe propaganda and support the status quo

it might be that young people on average are more sympathetic because they are less racist, but it's also because they are less comfortable and have already become skeptical of the narratives being sold by governments which they can clearly see have abandoned them

## Kill authorizations

*Main article:* [*Disposition Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix)

A secret National Security Council panel pursues the killing of an individual, including American citizens, who has been called a suspected terrorist.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14) In this case, no public record of this decision or any operation to kill the suspect will be made available.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14) The panel's actions are justified by ""two principal legal theories"": They ""were permitted by Congress when it [authorized the use of military forces against militants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists) in the wake of [the attacks of September 11, 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11); and they are permitted under international law if a country is defending itself.""[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14)

Homeland Security Advisor [John O. Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O._Brennan), who helped codify targeted killing criteria by creating the [Disposition Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix) database, has described the [Obama Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_Administration) targeted killing policy by stating that ""in order to ensure that our counterterrorism operations involving the use of lethal force are legal, ethical, and wise, President Obama has demanded that we hold ourselves to the highest possible standards and processes"".[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-15)

Reuters reported that [Anwar al-Awlaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki), an American citizen, was on such a kill list and was killed accordingly.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council#cite_note-reu1005-14)

On February 4, 2013, NBC published a leaked Department of Justice [memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/020413_DOJ_White_Paper) providing a summary of the rationale used to justify targeted killing of US citizens who are senior operational leaders of Al-Qa'ida or associated forces.

Israel was feeding this band instead of really wanting to avoid radicalization. They might have known that October attack to happen and let it, so if one day it is  and some proof of it is found, we could say it is even more criminal letting an attack to your own population.


The second is, it is a perverse statement to ask you first if you comdemn hamas in order that they say later, OK then and only then Israel has no right to overexcedeed. No, Israel went to far and that fact (and not Israel as a whole and all Israelis) must be condemned, and then once said ask you if you comdemn Hamas too, I cannot make my answer depending if you comdemn first hamas or not, perverse speech game.

"Ditto- I usually don't share too much to the entire Internet, but I lived in Beit Sahour (near Bethlehem) in 2009 and traveled all across the West Bank (Hebron, Ramallah, Tulkarem, Nablus, Jenin, and to some smaller towns), traveled around Israel, and even managed to visit the Gaza Strip for a week through Rafah (up and down the Strip, to Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun, and Gaza City).

The experience in Palestine was absolutely amazing, especially as an American Jew. Welcomed everywhere I went, people were genuinely friendly and willing to show us around their towns without expectation that we would pay them (the tour guide scam). So many fantastic family dinners, big spreads of food, great discussions. It was life-changing.

My most eye-opening experience was how pretty much every Palestinian would openly welcome Jews or even Israelis, but condemned the Zionist agenda that occupies Palestine. Even in Hebron when the Israeli forces started tear gassing and shooting and we all fled into a shop to hide, I was a bit shell-shocked and started to confuse Hebrew words into my Arabic, to the point where the shopkeeper obviously knew I was Hebrew-speaking when I used the Hebrew word for bread (""le5em"") instead of the Arabic word (""5ubez""- the Hebrew word meant ""meat"" even though I was trying to say ""bread""). The shopkeeper's eyes opened wide, he reached out and shook my hand, and said that anybody that would stand with Palestinians is welcome in his shop. The overwhelming amount of humanity and humility taught me lessons I'll never forget.

On the contrary, Israelis treated me great when they figured I was in their ethnic group. It changed a bit when they learned I was ethnically part-Arab. It changed a whole lot when they learned I did not agree with the occupation of Palestine, and that's when I nearly got shot...",2023-11-27 19:45:24

The best way forward is a series of active and passive protests by wearing Palestinian clothing and replacing conventional foods with Palestinian cuisines. Have open to the public documentary screening- something that the likes of Gal Gadot won't do. There is a drink in Bangladesh with the label ""I support Palestine"". Maybe local snacks, street food, drinks, etc. can have that. Even when this activity is localised within cities like Washington DC, NYC, LA and San Francisco, it has pretty big effects.

i probably didn‚Äôt need to say all of this‚Äî bottom line is i can feel a similar pain to you, i‚Äôve always been shown love from anyone of a minority here and everyone is so special. i hate that people don‚Äôt see this, i hate the lies being told and most of all i hate that people believe it. i myself have gotten a lot of hate especially when spreading the word about the protest/vigil i‚Äôm organizing and lately i just feel burnt out and depressed. i don‚Äôt think i could keep going if i didn‚Äôt see people like you around every now and then who see it too ü§çü§ç",2023-11-28 00:53:11

When my Palestinian driver came and helped me, he spoke to me on the car ride to my accommodation and he was so friendly and warm just asking me very basic questions that he found interesting. 

Then, when it was time to fly back to Europe, the treatment I received in Ben Gurion was so disgusting. One of the worst experiences of my life only because I taught in Palestine. I was fighting with the security lady because she was just so hateful, asking me why on earth would I teach in Palestine. They took me through every level of security with an insanely watchful eye. They went through my luggage and I believe intentionally left things open so that it spilled all over my clothes and damaged some of them. 

My students, though sometimes difficult to control were great. Curious and funny! They were middle schoolers, and they didn‚Äôt say anything antiseptic to me once. Literally just that Israelis wanted to kill them and they would die for Palestine.

"The current political party in control of Israel ""LiKud""

It was founded by ""Menachem Begin"" also The leader of ""Irgun"" the terrorist organization. 

He specifically led this organization during the Deir Yassin massacre where they killed women and children.
 
He was also their leader during the bombing of the King David Hotel.

In 2005 Israel awarded convicted terrorists with certificates of appreciation to celebrate their involvement in bombing U.S owned businesses. 

Menachem Begins mentor was the founder of Irgun and the ""father"" of revisionist zionism. ""Ze'ev Jabotinsky""

He believed the only way forward was to establish a Jewish state by force. By any means necessary..

He also ""predicted"" the Holocaust in a speech made in 1938. (In 2023 a couple of zionists 'debunked' this speech but clearly you have to take the source into account ;p)

In 1939 the British enacted the MacDonald white paper 

""The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the Peel Commission's idea of partitioning Palestine. It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for five years and ruled that further immigration would then be determined by the Arab majority (section II). Jews were restricted from buying Arab land in all but 5% of the Mandate (section III)  



In response Janotonsky planned an attack with Irgun. He colluded the very anti-Semitic (sarcasm) polish government who began supplying arms and training to Irgun members.



The truth of the origin of these terrorists and their ideology should be taught to more people. If this was the case hopefully they wouldn't get away with saying stuff like this but I'm begging to believe it doesn't matter either way.",2023-12-01 14:30:18

"I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/185by20/comment/kb1hqzy/?) about 'narcissistic rage' a few days ago.  Beyond rage there is physical abuse, which I think this guy exemplifies.  He's actually admitting to and describing his own narcissistic abuse escalation and his mental progression, elsewhere too such as on his Instagram (thank you to the person who linked that).

Physical abuse is often discussed in terms of domestic abuse, but I personally believe that it crops up in many superior/subordinate situations.  It turns the victim into a subordinate, in what should be an equal footing relationship or, at the least, an equal human rights relationship.

I view Israel's military and settler behavior as ticking all these items.  This is especially *clear* with the bloodlust statements and behaviors that are becoming public recently, like this OP.  But, I think and infer that it's been the case for a very long time.

This link contains rather more than I've excerpted here.  I think it's valuable to read in whole, as it details how the progression of violence goes.

1. Intimidation ‚Ä¶ The narcissistic spouse becomes a bully ‚Ä¶
2. Isolation ‚Ä¶ The narcissist substantially limits their spouses ability to escape especially in dangerous situations. ‚Ä¶
3. Restraint ‚Ä¶ The narcissist will confine their spouse by blocking a doorway, grabbing when trying to leave, locking doors with no key, or tying the person up. This causes a feeling of entrapment or imprisonment without any way to escape. ‚Ä¶
4. Aggression ‚Ä¶ Because the narcissist will blame their spouse for their violent behavior, they will not stop using force once it is started. They will instead find more reasons to justify their brutality.
5. Endangerment ‚Ä¶ The narcissist then realizes they are no longer commanding the same level of fear, so they escalate the attacks. Verbal threats of killing their spouse, family members or themselves are mixed with physical violence and use of weapons. ‚Ä¶",2023-12-01 18:54:05

"Funny how an educated journalist can go so quickly from preaching how to be Jewish by doing good, to calling for the genocide of Palestinians. Also interesting to note how he would be dubbed a terrorist if you'd reverse the context as I did below.

""How to be Jewish: Be good. The end."" 

**Yoni Leviatan, Times of Israel journalist, 1 December 2023 (original context):**

""""""To those who reply to me with pictures of the damage and destruction in Gaza as if this is supposed to be something that moves me, you should know how much I really, truly in my heart don't care. In fact, this is what the saying ""I couldn't care less"" was made for. 

When I see dead Gazans, I don't see dead Gazans ‚Äì I see the dead Israelis who came before them. 

When I see suffering Gazans, I don't see suffering Gazans ‚Äì I see the suffering Israelis being kept in dark dungeons underground. 

You see, Hamas's attack on October 7 was so successful that it blinded all of us to anything related to Gaza, Gazans or the troubles of either one. 

We only see blue and white now. 

And we are angrier than ever. Our blood is boiling hotter than ever. We care less about Gaza than ever. We care less about world opinion than ever. We want the @IDF to use more firepower than ever. 

But most of all, we want our people back more than ever ‚Äì and will do whatever it takes. Literally, anything. Nothing's off the table. Mercy is a foreign concept that has no application here. The opposite ‚Äì we want our army to attack with whatever the opposite of mercy is. 

We're more insistent than ever that the war will continue into southern Gaza until it reaches all the way to Qatar where the Mossad has formally been instructed to draw up plans for taking out the cowardly Hamas leaders hiding like little rats. 

And every day this war continues, our feelings get stronger. Our anger gets stronger. Our thirst for revenge gets stronger. Our willingness to cause massive damage without the slightest care in the world in our quest to free our people has already gotten so strong ‚Äì and will continue to get stronger ‚Äì that Gaza will long for the wars of past which will seem like a trip to Disney in comparison. 

But most of all, we're more insistent than ever that Palestinians will never have a state anywhere near our borders. Those dreams died along with our people on October 7. 

There is a time for peace and a time for war. I strongly suggest to all the well-meaning diplomats who keep trying to pressure Israel into peace with the Palestinians to save their energies and focus their efforts elsewhere where they have a chance of success. 

Because now is a time for war. All-out war. War without mercy.

You have to understand, Israel as a nation and Israeli society is not emotionally or mentally normal. Are there normal people AMONG them? Of course. But the very foundation of their society is based on ""We were hunted once and we're going to be hunted again, so we need to GET THEM before they get us!"" mixed with ""The world *owes* us this, God *gave* us this, WE ARE GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE,"" mixed with ""Brown people bad.""

"What was the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising? What was the Easter Rising? What was the Battle of Wabash River? They were all *resistance.*

October 7th was a revolt against an oppressive power that has stolen the homes and land of Palestinian families and forced the surviving citizens of Palestine to live in ""the world largest concentration camp"". A power that commits war crimes and crimes against humanity in doing so, and has for nearly 20 years now (this after ~55 years of mistreatment already on the record). A power that has habitually ""mown the lawn"" that is Gaza (read: murdered civilians unprovoked), broken ceasefires brokered by members of Hamas, and assassinated people making real effort to broker long-term peace.

And before somebody cries, ""but they took hostages!"" Take a long, hard, *real* look at the people being released by Israel in exchange for Hamas hostages. What were their crimes? Why were they imprisoned? Why were they tortured and beaten? Were any of them given a fair trial, and sentenced? No. They weren't. They sound like hostages to me, and some of them had been kept from their families for *years.* They were snatched off the streets and from their homes, all because they're the ""wrong"" colour, the ""wrong"" religion, the ""wrong"" race. Most of them were children. Think about that, really *think* about that.

When Hamas attacked Israel with such vengeance I decided to find out why there was so much hate. Now I do not care what side anyone is on, those were crimes against innocent people and of course I was repulsed by what happened and still am. I hope the people responsible are held to account.

What has horrified me to the point of it having me question my whole belief system on the western powers being the good guys is currently being shattered. Most people are in total support of Israel doing what they are doing and justifying the death of ordinary people who have nothing to do with the attack last week.

It is like if I show compassion to innocent people being murdered somehow it means I am a Hamas sympathizer or something.

Having read what Israel has done at least in the last 15 years which is horrific, then you add on they had to be told by the US to turn on drinking water and there is a continual string of ""accidents"" for all the murders going on as well as denial of food and medicine, I am just so ashamed that my country and most of its inhabitants are OK with killing innocent people as long as it is the ""right innocent people""

"The more information I read about this atrocity the more odd it becomes as it is being reported by media outlets. While the hospital has been damaged during the fighting,  it is being reported that this was a rocket fired by a Hamas soldiers (I am no longer using the term militant because Palestine is a country and soldiers fight for a country) and the rocket was mis guided and landed in the the courtyard. I find it strange that this rocket which was also claimed to have had some sort of malfunction as some ""experts"" have put it, managed to strike the exact area innocent people were taking shelter resulting in their deaths. Many media outlets are also saying that palestinian officials are also inflating this number. I find this hard to believe because of the concentration of people in the area.    For something portrayed as a bumbling miss fire (this is how it reads to me) it sure did find it's way to a sensitive target and MISS the Anglican run hospital almost entirely. The IDF says hospitals are not targets and that even the crater is too small for them and their weapons. Really? The IDF has access to a multitude of high tech weapons, even nuclear weapons but not rockets. Does this mean they do not have anything that could have caused this damage? I find this hard to believe and while my opinion on this may not be a popular one I'm going to say that I believe they are lying.",2023-10-19 09:42:44

[And here's another one going around](https://twitter.com/Omarfsa2/status/1714349451651719581)

[Video from a Palestinian source](https://twitter.com/qudsn/status/1714335703117570261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1714335703117570261%7Ctwgr%5E5be5a528cd900e7392a1d90cce60cf8f8f60dbce%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesofisrael.com%2Fliveblog_entry%2Fisrael-publishes-video-it-says-proves-failed-rocket-launch-caused-gaza-hospital-blast%2F)

I think the best way to debunk it, if it is false, would be to cross-check the videos to see if the explosions line up or something. At the moment, but to remain skeptical of both sides in my opinion, although I think it's more likely this was an Israeli airstrike rather than one of Hamas' rockets malfunctioning.

As for the videos I sent, I noticed that some stuff doesn't really line up. There's three videos posted. The videos all have conflicting time stamps. The one in the bottom right says it was filmed on the 18th of October which isn't possible at all, so I think the timestamps may have been tampered with.

However, if it is true that Hamas stores munitions in hospitals(which definitely is possible) then it wouldn't be far fetched for this to be a rocket malfunction hitting the munitions storage.

Update: Official Israel Twitter account [edited their post](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-publishes-video-it-says-proves-failed-rocket-launch-caused-gaza-hospital-blast/) to remove the video once people pointed out the inconsistencies in the timing.",2023-10-17 17:02:11

The overwhelming majority of people getting killed in Gaza, and in all of the various major operations Israel has had in Gaza (where more than a few hundred have died) have been civilians. Every time. There's no comparison.

However illegal the invasion of Ukraine was, and hower cruel it is, and all of the war crimes that have been committed, you cannot deny that it is being faught far more humanely than whatever Israel is doing against Palestinians. Neither Ukraine nor Russia dehumanize their victims the way Israel does. Neither of them have anything like the Dahiya doctrine, where they respond to enemy attacks by completely levelling civilian neighbourhoods of the enemy (that's what the Nazis used to do with saboteurs):

But this is clearly a case of ""brown people lesser than us whites""/""the west has the moral right"" (https://youtu.be/n3wcjwY4mz8?si=NIPeOF729PBesrEQ)

Turns out being part of the global dominant heagemony not only harms those not in the heagemony, but also ourselves to a lesser extent, but a pernicious one. I don't get how we can be so blinded by money that we still don't see the innate instability of the status quo. 


Anyway, that was my shit attempt at saying sorry for the divide we in the west have created and still benefit from. Even before the sheer clarity of this situation. Sorry if fucked up on saying that, I've only recently become aware of the sheer state of propaganda I've been getting, to the point where I genuinely believed up until 2018 that Israel-Palestine was a power-symmetric conflict, instead of globally approved genocide in the name of western present in the middle east.

">What the actual fuck. There are cities in Ukraine that no longer exist becasue the russian destroyed them.

Yes, and said cities are evacuated, and certainly allowed it, before it becomes the war zone they are, and destroyed to pieces, like Bakhmut. Which is why civilian casualties are extremely low compared to military casualties. The preliminary numbers are there and you can look it up, if you don't believe me.

Compare those numbers to Gaza, which Israel has turned into a concentration camp, where nobody or nothing can come and leave except under Israeli supervision, since 2006. They tell people to evacuate a city, when they have it completely boxed in, an area that has among the highest population densities in the world. And despite Israel having access to far more advanced precision-weapons than Ukraine and Russia, they still fire indiscriminately upon civilian areas, and often on civilians where no military target were present; that much has been documented time and time again by reports from human rights organizations over the years. Look at UN report for the 2018 protests, or Amnesty reports for the Gazay war in 2008 and 2014 as an example. Israel purposefully targets civilians and/or indiscriminately fires on civilian areas. Israel's claims of human shields are also refuted in almost every instance (incidentally, Amnesty found a pattern of the Ukrainian army occupuing civilian areas, including schools and hospitals, without evacuating civilians from those areas).

The number of civilians, even children alone, who die compared to combatants, is disgusting. The former make up the overwhelming majority. They did in 2008. They did in 2014. And preliminary numbers, although this war has just ""begun"", has already civilians as an overwhelming majority of casualties in Gaza. 

There's simply no comparison, in combatant/civilian death ratio, to Ukraine/Russia. The latter, despite its far greater intensity, is being fought far more humanely. 

>Don't you fucking dare attempt to deny the genocide the russians are commiting.

It's not genocide. Stop ruining that word, please. It was first used to describe what the Nazis were doing to Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, etc., which was the targeted attempt at wiping out entire peoples through mass killings. Is Israel doing it in Gaza? No. Is Russia doing this in Ukraine? Not even close. 

People often conflate ethnic cleansing or masscares with genocide. These things are not the same thing. What happened to the Native Americans in the 1500s-1900 was genocide. Guetemalan Indians in the 1950s was genocide. What Turkey was doing to Armenians in the 1910s was genocide.

"Assumption about the attack on the hospital

I'm thinking that the attack on the hospital was carried out by Israel as a warning, in the sense that in the previous days the hospital had already been warned with attacks to make those inside leave the hospital (with `only` 4 injured ), but no one left the hospital. So yesterday they sent in a warning airstrike increasing the firepower (that's why there is no crater). And from here it got out of hand because news started coming out about hundreds of deaths, and from there they had to deny that it was them because they had no way of having `real` news on the situation, because the first news/video on the situation occurred the next morning.
So they have to stay with their position.

"So you sarcastically said in reply to my comment ""I guess 3000 people were killed by misfires"", but you didn't mean that that's what my comment implied? In that case, what was the actual point of you saying those words? Do you understand the meaning of what you said? Is English your first language? (No problem if it's not, by the way - it's just that it would explain things a little.)

Why do you think that calling this a misfire means the remaining civilian deaths aren't war crimes? Are you aware that this thought sequence has no logical progression? Is this how you come to all your opinions on this topic? Or is there simply a language barrier at play here, making you appear irrational?

Misfired rockets have hit places in Gaza. How is it that you don't know this? Gaza has been hit by both Israeli and Hamas and IJ missiles every day since the latest outburst of violence. Again, how is it that you aren't aware of something this basic and undisputed? Either side would be simply insane to deny this. 

It hit somewhere Israel had ordered to evacuate because Israel has ordered evacuation of the entirety of Northern Gaza (a war crime). So it's not a big coincidence at all. Failed Gazan rockets are statistically bound to hit places that have been ordered to evacuate, as there are so many of both.

Once these people leave there is always a chance that they will not return.

My guess is it all comes down to how Hamas fighters fair against Israeli ground troops. If they can inflict some serious losses, especially against reservists, the Israeli resolve will disintergrate very quickly. They will realize their safety is not guaranteed in Israel and will re-locate to their second passport countries.

"So, I‚Äôm First Nations from Canada. I‚Äôm Canadian through and through. On my dads side I‚Äôm like the 13th or 14th generation French Canadian. My moms side- well we‚Äôve been in Canada since forever. 
I am having a really difficult time figuring out exactly what is going on and which news channels are non-biased, so that I can get the best information that is also trustworthy. 
Since I was 10, up until a few years ago, I was reading and educating myself a lot about WW2 and about the Holocaust. So I have a lot of empathy for anyone who suffered in the concentration camps. I‚Äôve been to one, they‚Äôre haunting- they‚Äôre awful. So, of course at first I was like ‚ÄúIsrael has a right to defend themselves and do what they need to do to protect themselves‚Äù, but then I started learning a bit about Palestine because I thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs two sides to this‚Äù and I started to gain an appreciation and empathy for Palestine. 
I, right now, am still so confused about who is who and why they are doing what they are doing. 
My instant thought was ‚ÄúWhat is Israel doing? Why are they doing this to Palestine. This is awful‚Äù and I was getting upset that so many people were siding with Israel without question. 
Then you have the video footage of Hamas kidnapping people and reports of people being brutality murdered by Hamas. So then I get confused about who Hamas is, and why they are doing this‚Ä¶ like how I understand it is that Israel has been slowly taking over Palestinian territory over the years? Which is awful. Idk how they could do this. 
So, Hamas is the gov‚Äôt party in power, and they‚Äôre voted in? If they are why would people vote for them? Are they being forced? Are they rigging elections? 
Then you see the bombings going on in Gaza and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so difficult to ‚Äúchoose a side‚Äù because at the end of the day I believe it‚Äôs leadership who are fucking over the civilians. Is this about religion? Land? Culture? Power? What is it. 
I have an understanding of what is happening, but the news makes it really difficult to get a grasp of the chaos that is happening. 
It‚Äôs heartbreaking, and I just want to make everything better. Because if there is anything I can understand is a group of ppl taking over your lands. They did that to us in Canada and now we have so many issues. It‚Äôs awful. 
I have no I‚Äôll intentions behind my comments. I‚Äôm just giving you my honest opinion based on the information I can find that I think is reliable.

"As an American who has been an activist for Palestine liberation for at least 20 years, I am horrified and disgusted and heartbroken, especially because my taxes are paying for this terror. I know it‚Äôs not much, but I am so sorry that my country is playing such an active role in this genocide. 

What‚Äôs most disturbing to me is how much Palestinian voices and those of allies are being quashed in a country where we‚Äôre supposed to have a First Amendment. Goons will always find a way around. This is why much of the world is clueless about what is happening on the ground. 

If you‚Äôre in the States, or in a place where you‚Äôre relatively safe to express yourself, and have enough privilege to speak up and act, please please say something. Call your Congress members. Every day. I am represented by a conservative Democrat who‚Äôs a war hawk and doesn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass, but I still hold her accountable, in phone calls, emails, and in letters to the editor calling her out for her support for genocide. These only cost time. 

October 4 is a day of action and there‚Äôs likely a protest near you. Go to it. Show the world that we see what‚Äôs happening and we won‚Äôt be silenced. 

What‚Äôs most infuriating is how much those in solidarity with Palestine are actively being silenced in the guise of ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù, which is complete bullshit. We see you, Gaza. We‚Äôre just fighting like hell to make sure the world does too. 

If you‚Äôre Palestinian in the diaspora, please as much as you can, take care of yourselves, because your loved ones need you. Let us white privileged folks take the load off a little.

Meanwhile the PA has become an extension of the occupation and an enforcer of the settler colonial policies in Israel. 

Maybe my view is controversial but we are not helping ourselves in this situation. Hamas is not a group to be lionized and admired. Almost 10% of their fighter base are collaborators (which makes it even more shocking that Israel didn't know). Haniyeh has relatives/nephews who SERVED in the IDF. His sister is Israeli. No other group has such strong ties to Israel than Hamas. So no I don't admire them.",2023-10-28 09:12:58

Being amongst colonial Europe for so long these European Jews may have also unconsciously absorbed colonial perspectives & racism. They may see how successful the colonial powers were & still are. They don't want to suffer anymore, so they aspire to be the oppressors because it's either oppress or be oppressed in their PTSD deranged mind. They internalised that racism against non-white is acceptable, that non-white are subhuman, & therefore non-white lives don't matter to them.

Thankfully not all Jews are like that. Even some Holocaust survivors & ultra religious Jews are horrified by these genocidal Zionists. There are also leftist Jews who truly believe in universal human rights & are trying to speak out against Israeli atrocities. But they get smeared as anti-semitic self-hating Jews by these extreme racist Zionists who run the Israeli gov.

If Israel is indeed doing this (we didn‚Äôt have power back then, so fuck you because we are in power now, let‚Äôs see how you like it - please excuse any ignorance displayed here, it‚Äôs not easy to understand WHY), they‚Äôre nothing but the same Nazi ideal bastards that hurt them!

Jews are not Nazis. Neither are Israel. But they‚Äôre using the same words and techniques (no communications in PAL, Nazis put Jews into ghettoes and sealed them off), and they are no better than those who ran/organised/agreed with the Holocaust if they do that.

All the other guys are what you can call ""performative liberals & activists"". They like to give an opinion when it's safe that they are 100% on the right side. Mocking and laughing about Trump and republican stupidity is a low hanging fruit because the jokes write themselves. 

But in this situation,  when you need to make an effort , they fall silent,  not only because i bet they don't know what the fuck they and how they are going say it, but also they have the media bosses censoring any opinions that doesn't fall to their agenda.

John Cusack has always been outspoken and unafraid of what others may think of him for doing so.,2023-11-07 16:56:12
"On October 25th Jon Stewart, alongside other media figures, signed an open letter urging president Joe Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. \[[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20231020203649/https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/hollywood-demands-gaza-israel-ceasefire-joaquin-phoenix-cate-blanchett-1235763646/)\]\[[2](https://web.archive.org/web/20231020223525/https://www.artists4ceasefire.org/)\].

Call him what you want but at least he's one of *us*, not one of *them*.

edit to clarify because of what's happening in the world. By us vs them, I mean the ones acknowledging the atrocities going on, and actually daring to do something about them.",2023-11-07 22:38:05

"Okay, in Trevor Noah's case, he hasn't been the Host of The Daily Show since early this year, so you can't put his face here; that's unfair. Nonetheless, I am very disappointed by the silence from Stephen Colbert. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he would give weekly updates about the situation, especially presenting the events in a humorous way, typically at the expense of the Russians. Yet, suddenly, despite the current Israeli bombing of Gaza claiming more civilian lives than the entirety of the current Ukrainian war, he's staying silent. Yeah, Stephen Colbert was the last Late Night show host I followed after Trevor Noah retired, and now I'm no longer following any of them ever again.",2023-11-07 21:07:21

Jon Stewart is a different person. He sees both sides then sides with the civilians being affected and condemns the political theater going on that completely ignores their plight. He acknowledges what Israel has done over the last 60+ years even though he is Jewish. He also wants Palestinians to govern themselves independently from being used as cover.

These people, this Zionist scum truly are modern day National Socialists.

They are also extreme racists in the purest sense of the word; they believe they are superior, more moral and pure than others people, that the others are inherently violent, that the others do not deserve the same rights as they, that they are a lesser form of life.
In highschool I saw the propaganda movie the Eternal Jew. It shocked me to my core that such evil is possible. But in time I realized it wasn't in any way unique to the Germans people, that others were just as capable of it.
