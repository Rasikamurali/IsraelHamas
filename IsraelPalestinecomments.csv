2,"Central European here.
Before, I was undecided, thinking both were a problem, but with a certain sympathy for Palestine.
Well, now the sides are clear to me and I hope that Israel gets rid of Hamas once and for all, even if it gets messy.",2023-10-08 07:22:22
3,"I was coming of age during the second intifada and learned about Israel and Palestine and became pro-Palestinian. Over the past several years I've been becoming more pro-Israel as I journied from conservative to liberal to socialist. Also prior to this I came out, so this has been a journey for sure.

It's incredibly naive to be LGBT and to support an ideology that would murder you the moment they had a chance. I believe the Star Wars effect play into this as well where there is this understanding that if you are a smaller resistance fighting against an empire then you are automatically the underdog and right by default.

I want peace. I want a two state solution. I want a free and secure Palestine alongside Israel. But if one side only sees peace as possible so long as the otherside is cleansed from the land... Ultimately what has happened over the past couple days is going to turn many middle of the road types more into the pro-Israel camp.",2023-10-08 07:44:32

5,"the Jews had a state, lost it to imperial powers (Assyrian then Babylonian), had a state, lost it to imperial powers (Seleucids), had a state (Hasmonean), lost it to imperial powers (Roman), fought for a state and didn’t win (Bar Kochba), after which the empire in charge renamed Judea to Palestina, as an insult, the land then was ruled by Romans, then Byzantines (East Romans), until another foreign army, with a foreign ethnicity and foreign religion (Arab Muslims) invaded, took over, and never left, the ultimate “settler colonists,” until 1948, following the worst genocide in human history, Jews fought for and established a liberal democracy on their historic homeland. Israel has every right to exist.",2023-10-08 08:07:23
6,"I changed my mind. I thought the IDF actually harmed Palestinians and I thought their last behavior was a human rights issue. But after seeing these animalistic Palestinian Muslim Jihadists Terrorist Hamas low lives murder, rape, and torture children, young girls, the elderly, they need to be wiped out. Any Jihadist extremism needs to be eliminated. And Israel needs to enforce stricter policies or a more effective occupation. This is absolutely one of the worst crimes against humanity cases in a developed country, aside from Ukraine. 
We see this conflict in Turkey/Kurds, Russia/Ukraine, USA/Native Americans, China/Taiwan-Uighur, Burma/Rohingya, Hutus/Tutsi. This is nothing new. An apartheid, a one or two state solution that is undeniably impossibly to uphold and implement. These acts of terror and crime are predominantly done by Jihadist Muslims, with the exception of Russia/Ukraine. No side is truly innocent. All sides have reacted in context of self defense. However, this needs to stop. Enough is enough. When will there be enough rape, murder, and corruption? If you support Hamas, you are a terrorist. You are Anti-Semitic. If you support Free Palestine through the persecution and murder of Jews, you are also a terrorist. Crimes against humanity should not take a side or be affiliated politically with one group of people who feel oppressed and need solidarity. Crimes against humanity are simply, crimes against humanity. No matter if you’re Palestinian MuslIm, Israeli Jew, Ukrainian, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Burmese, Rohingya, etc. This is not right. We need to stop fighting against each other and leveling ourselves supports of Israel of Palestine. But right now, I support justice. And if Israel needs to defend her land from this terror attack and reclaim their citizens who are being held hostage, I support that because that is an act of justice. Also, the fact that the President of Palestine isn’t reprimanding those horrors tells me all I need to know. He condones evil and violence. Lastly, for those of who don’t know, there is a video on combat footage showing a Palestinian Jihadist father using his infant child as a shield as he yells at him and tells him to walk towards the Israeli soldiers and raise his Palestinian flag. This is evil. It is selfish. That is not justice. I hope you consider the weight of your opinion and outlook. If we keep diving Jews vs Muslim we will always be at war and face discrimination. We need to unite and agree that there are good and innocent Jews and Muslims who do not deserve this. We need to agree as separate groups of people that before we are Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian, Israeli, we are HUMAN. And as humans, let’s come together and support justice. Let’s not support the Hamas who parade miser and rape. Support the people who have been killed and those who have been abused by the Hamas.",2023-10-08 09:57:10

12,"As a resident of Israel, I'm glad you changed your mind.

The damage they have done to us is unbearable. My friends, my brothers, were brutally murdered, taken prisoner in Gaza, and all this for what? Because we want to live in **one** country of Jews without fear?

This fear has been around for a long time and has permeated us. We are absolutely shocked.

At least now, the world is with us. The world is on our side. And we are going to win. They declared war.

35,"Yes, definitely.

I was Pro-Palestinian, still kinda am because I think Israel should drive its settlers out of west bank and give more autonomy to West Bank and Gaza and make 2 state-solution. But after watching today's videos, i can't possibly deny that Hamas are fucking terrorists. They're taking young jewish girls as hostages, who have nothing to do with the politics. They're slaughtering any Israeli who comes their way, they are entering people's homes and killing them in their houses. They aren't sparing anyone-not the women or the children. They are parading dead bodies of Israelis. This is FUCKING DISGUSTING AND VILE. This is not resistance, this is terrorism..

But you know, what I found even more disgusting and horrifying than these graphic videos? I'm seeing stories of Arabs online, and they're PRAISING HAMAS, they're posting videos of houses and streets burning with Quranic verses playing in the background, they're praising their ""BROTHERS"" for their bravery. This is making a pit in my stomach.

If israel wipes Gaza in the next few days, i wouldn't be surprised. And what's worse is that I know in the coming few days, so many of innocent Gazans will be killed because of this stupid Hamas",2023-10-08 09:26:22
36,"This is Israel's 9/11 moment. 600+ Israelis dead. Parading bodies through the streets as people cheer on. These people are uncivilized savages.

If anything it shows that all Israel's security policies have been justified, because they are extremely dangerous.

Israel should have every right to occupy the entirety of the region, and enact a total police state. This would be to the benefit of the peaceful Palestinians too. It is clear that they cannot look after themselves, and they cannot manage to run anything, and just devolve into terrorism.

**Israel is a huge benefit to the global community.**

They are a prosperous nation, delivering technology and innovation to the benefit of the world. 

**The Palestinians offer nothing to the global community at all except endless pain, misery and destabilization.**

Just like the term ""Prussian"" has disappeared from usage, so should the term ""Palestinian"". We can still use the term Palestinian for militarism, aggressiveness and conservatism, but the people who call themselves Palestinians and want peace should dissociate from this identity that is based on nothing more than failure, terrorism and vengance.

Case closed as far as I am concerned.",2023-10-08 13:25:15
37,I am Palestinian and have lived in the West Bank. Western leftists thinking they are supporting the noble underrdog by cheerleading Hamas don't understand that these people are not like them.

38,"You were taken in by propaganda.     

The world has a short memory.

39," No my position has not changed because It's not Israel versus Palestine. It's Israel vs Hamas. I am anti terrorism but I am also anti-apartheid. My stance has been and always will be a solution in which Israel and Palestine can live side by side peacefully.

What Hamas is doing to innocent people is wrong but to use this as a justification that all Palestinians are bad and deserve the wrath of Israel is equally wrong. It's one thing to support Israel's right to defend themselves but it should not come at the expense of the lives of innocent Palestinian people either.

The outrage people are feeling for the innocent Israelis being raped and murdered is correct but equally so all the people going on about the lack of empathy,humanity etc the jihadis are showing should have the same energy for the innocent Palestinians who suffer daily too, including women and children ( who aren't going around raping and murdering and simply trying to survive). Do you think IDF has not raped, murdered and tortured Palestinians and this is a one sided war?

Israel defending itself is one thing but they fire indiscriminately on Palestine everytime there has been an attack by Hamas. Why is one sides suffering more important than the others? 

I feel for the Israeli and Palestinian people who are both suffering.",2023-10-08 11:08:29
40,"Not really. I've always supported Israel's plight for their tiny nation. The maps that were drawn up were dogshit in the first place. Palestine while I do sympathize with their nation building desire they lack the diplomatic tact required to actually bring it about. Militarily they suck. If you lose more than one conflict for your independence you have to stay on the peaceful path if you want to build your own country. Especially if your only military ""strategy"" is to indescribably bomb civilian infrastructure. Just look at the Ukrainian struggle the missiles they use are used exclusively to target military targets. Tit for tat. But Russia responds by shooting at apartment blocks.

The rest of the surrounding middle eastern countries?  They have financial support too ya know - and yet - death, tribalism and holy war!  Israel has killed tonnes of innocent civilians, which is tragic - but it's Hamas purposefully launching rockets near buildings surrounded by innocents.

45,"Both sides have been resolving to terror. What we are seeing now, and in the past, from Hamas is without a doubt terrorism and it's despicable. 
Make no mistake that,  while I support Israel, they too have killed over 2500 Palestinian children in the last 3 years. 

Israel has a large and sophisticated military and and justifies their killing and land grab as part of their fight against terrorism, but make no mistake they have been killing Palestinians and taking their homes and lands since 1948. 
Palestinians, on the other hand, don't have the firepower to go against the Israeli military. Hence, they resolve to rerrorism. 

Neither side is innocent. they're killing civilians, and that has to stop. 

If you look at the Israelis, they're all white. Northern European White. Most of them, at least. 

All relocated from Europe after WWII. Europe didn't want the Jews so instead of ""expelling"" them, they created the state of Israel in Palestine under the pretext that this was their promised land. 

Simply, you have Jews relocating to Israel from all over the world as long as they're Jewish, they can be Israeli citizens. In 1922 there were less than 100,000 Jewish people living in Palestine.

Jews left the area 2500 years ago. 
While they do have a claim in the area, you can not ethnic cleans those who live in the area you're taking over.  

Palestinians, on the other hand, are natives of that land never moved away. 

This land grab has been going on for over 80 years. 
Give Palestine its statehood, and all these senseless wars will stop.
Both sides must coexist there's no power way. 

European powers and USA support Israel because they don't want the Jews in their countries. If they stop supporting Israel, Iran along with some Arab nations will push the Israelis out very quickly. In turn 6million Jews will be back in Europe and USA. And they simply don't want ray.  

Here we have two sides that are systematically persecuted and the only solution is to coexist!

I'm sure there will be cruelty towards Palestinians as a result of this war, but in general Israel has always done things like warn Gaza before a strike, ask civilians to take shelter, etc. Hamas goes out of its way to use citizens as human shields, and instigate attacks for their own propaganda.",2023-10-08 13:18:26

As much as I want to advocate peace and restraint, I just don't see how us moderates can realistically ask for restraint from Israel after this. Palestine is about to suffer some vicious reprisals and nobody in the world is going to step in because they've brought this one on themselves.

At this rate, I think it will be for the best just to fully occupy Palestine and push them out. Messy in the short term but resolves the issue because peaceful cooperation is never going to work it seems.",2023-10-08 13:55:50
56,"Nope. Not going to get into what's justified or not, but this shouldn't be unexpected. People can only be pushed so far before they push back however they can, and I have yet to see any civil war or other similar conflict between people rather than armies that didn't look pretty much exactly like this. Is it unfortunate that civilians are dying? Absolutely, but that was always true, and the crimes being perpetrated now are no different than the ones that came before, just reversed and packed into a shorter time. Whether you believe it's morally right or wrong, what has been done to the Palestinians for years and decades is a far greater suffering than anything Hamas could ever inflict back in days or weeks, and I think it's important for people to understand that. This did not happen in a vacuum, this did not happen unprovoked, and despite how cruel and/or vicious it is, it's not a *disproportionate* response in its scale (like what tends to happen in the other direction, and likely will in this case too). I just hope this incident galvanises enough of the right people to bring them to the table and actually deliver positive, meaningful resolution to a conflict that has stagnated and become more hopeless than ever, but I'm not holding my breath.

My thoughts (preface I’m still working through this so I might mis-type) - I feel as though when I look at Israeli injustice, it’s doesn’t land the same way because of intentionality.

Israel did not build the separation barriers and blockade for no reason, they did so in reaction to fatah and hamas violence respectively. Therefore when I see Palestinians being harmed I know intellectually it is wrong and disproportionate, but my subconscious goes “well, it’s happening due to Israel’s overreaction, not because Israel wants to harm the Palestinians in question”

When I see hamas fighters gang raping, kidnapping, mass executioning etc, the intention IS to harm civilians. Therefore there is a more visceral response. Even though Palestinians have objectively had it worse.

I’ve been thinking about this since it stated yesterday, my thoughts aren’t settled, so feedback is welcome.",2023-10-08 09:30:47

That being said, I find it so hard to understand why yesterday changed your perspective; I guess it can be chalked up to echo chambers? All sides have been open with their intentions for a long time. Videos of atrocities have existed for a long time - they share them openly, proudly. There is a difference between accidental collateral damage from organized military operations (attempting to prevent days like today) and a personal and methodical murder spree. 

I knew from an early age that wandering into the wrong neighboring city would have meant my death, my torture, and would likely end with my lifeless body being dragged through the streets by a cheering mob. My teenage hangouts, my city buses, were bombed by deranged people who strapped bombs to their chests. People in my life were murdered - driving on the highway, eating pizza, or just sleeping in their homes. This has happened many times before, just not on this scale. No matter what led to this cultural reality in places like Gaza, there are organized groups of monsters inside who laugh and cheer at human atrocities and raise their children to do the same.

The difference between them is that while the State of Israel cares for it's people, Hamas does not; and this conflict has confirmed me that. Hamas has committed an absolutely insane decision in making this attack, they're committing horrifying crimes against the israeli people, while at the same time dooming the palestinians in Gaza and possibly in the whole world. And that's cause they've never cared about the palestinians more than they care about their fundamentalist islamic ""values.""

I find a lot of the comments here quite disgusting, but I understand why are these things being said. It is this kind of hatred that fuels the treatment of palestines as second citizens, it is this kind of hatred that makes palestine in Gaza electing Hamas, dooming themselves in the process as they'll never be able to free peacifully from the claws of islamic fundamentalism, the same way the german people doomed themselves when they choose the Nazis due to underlying hatred and specially, despair.",2023-10-08 14:02:07

- IDF has to admit to its crimes and be held responsible for its atrocities
- Palestinians in Israel need to have the same civil rights as the Israelis
- Israel needs to stop their forced settlement in Palestinian areas
- Israel needs to protect its democracy from theocratic authoritarians like Netanjahu 

But also:
- Israel needs to be protected as the only democracy and free country in the region and should always be allowed to protect itself
- Gaza needs to be cleansed of the Hamas so these terrorists don't have their grip and anti Semitic manipulation over the Palestinians anymore
- Palestinians inside And outside Israel need to distance themselves from the crimes of Hamas so maybe maybe one day a two state solution is possible
- surrounding countries like Egypt need to keep working on their anti semitism and recognise Israel as a state

Seen and heard many instances of blood-curdling acts of barbarism from the Palestinian side, beyond that. The one thing that made me far more right wing than any of those, was talking to actual anti-Zionists online.

You need to understand that among the Israeli left, there's a weird assumption that anti-Zionists are their peers and comrades, not their mortal enemies, that can't tell the difference between them and right-wing Israelis. That antisemitism and anti-Zionism are occasionally linked, like among the heads of the Iranian regime or Hamas, or Western Neo-Nazis... but certainly not among educated, liberal Westerners. That those liberal Westerners actually are what they say: mere fighters for human rights, using objective standards, that would protect me and my family, just like it protects the Palestinians. That Zionism is a done deal, and anti-Zionism is the basically the same as left-wing Zionism. Opposing the settlements, supporting a two-state solution, supporting peace.

Hearing how very educated, eloquent actual anti-Zionists talk, made me realize that I was believing in complete nonsense. Even when the anti-Zionists who didn't shoot a single bullet in the back of an old lady's head, or slit a single Jewish child's throat, are tantamount to, say, white supremacists. People who believe in an ideology that's fundamentally not acceptable, and if implemented would lead to horrible atrocities against me and my family. 

The only real nuance here, is that some people who call themselves anti-Zionists were merely mislead about what anti-Zionism means (and are actually liberal Zionists or non-Zionists), and some anti-Zionists can put their horrible ideology aside, and concentrate on more rational goals.",2023-10-08 08:55:10

From a pragmatic viewpoint, in order for Israel to have security for its people; Palestinians should be forced out of Gaza and be allowed to seek refugee in other countries.   Israel should give aid money for relocation for those who leave willingly.  But otherwise, Israel is justified by clearing out people by force.

Edit: in response to the ‘ethnic cleansing’ reply.  Hamas codify their belief of, “declares all of Palestine a waqf, an unalienable religious property consisting of land endowed to Muslims in perpetuity by God,[320][y][322] with religious coexistence under Islam's rule.[323] The charter rejects a two-state solution, stating that the conflict cannot be resolved ""except through jihad"".

Israel still has as much right to exist as all the other countries with complicated origins. 

Palestinians still have a right to be angry, and we all have a moral obligation to work to make sure their legitimate grievances are addressed. 

The Palestinians as a group are still hard to work with because they’re wallowing in violent self-pity and getting too many people to wallow with them. 

No one can expect any Israeli to be full of peacemaking energy now, but they have not been radiating peacemaking energy in recent years.

Muslims will never stop as their religion tells them not to. So what are people supporting when they support these muslim causes?  How do they see these conflicts ending eventually?

The only time muslims will chill out is when they are the only ones left on earth. Thats is a fact and dont let a sly sneaky lying imam trick you into thinking otherwise. They are the BEST at lying, weasling and changing meaning when they discuss their cult. 

Israel needs to declare war on the ENTIRE muslim world.

Why is Israel inacting apartheid? 
- Palestinians say it is because Israelies are Zionists who want to control and eliminate them.
- Israel says it is to confine terrorists and ensure safety for their citizens

What do the Israelis want? 
 - Israelis say they want to live in their original homeland without persecution. A democratic state.
- Palestinians say Israelies want to cleanse them from their land and create a Jewish state. 

What do Palestinians want?
- Palestinians say they just want their homes back.
-Israelies say Palestinians want to take over and create a theocratic state devoid of Christians and jews. 


I think there is truth to both sides of these arguments, but the way this attack has gone, it is becoming clear where the true motivations lie.  Israel could have wiped out Palestinians if they wanted to. It would be easy. Israelies are nice enough to call before bombing targets and use precision munitions to minimize casualties. Meanwhile, Palestinians fire rockets indiscriminately and, when given the opportunity, murder and kidnap civilians directly. 

Their constant Allah akbar wails and religious chants drives home the fact that this is not about freedom.. it's about Jihad... about theocratic control. It is not illegal to be Muslim in Israel, that was never their goal.

Just like the argument that the ""Civil War was about states rights"" leads to the rhetorical question ""states rights to do what?""   The argument that ""Hamas fights for freedom of palestinians."" ""Freedom to do what?""

Both sides have delusional religious motivations, but there is a very clear ""lesser of two evils"" here. The veil of the poor downbeaten underdog fighting for freedom has been pulled off.

256,"This is such a complicated subject. It is incredibly interesting to me, I am a Canadian with no religious ties. I sympathize heavily with Jewish people and their continual oppression over the last few millennium.

After the 1947 UN backed partition plan of the British Mandate for Palestine, Arab Nations immediately declared war on Israel with the intend on seizing all of the newly formed Jewish State and the absolute rejection of the UN Partition Plan. One can argue that the lack of Arab consultation during the Partition Plan lead to its ultimate rejection among Arabs. Understand two things, firstly, the UK (which administered the Mandate for British Palestine prior to the 1947 Partition) was in a terrible economic and social condition from WW2 and thus eager to rid itself of the responsibility of administering what was rapidly turning into a warzone, and secondly Zionist movements were arguably more political organized and thus were able to advocate better for themselves at the UN, which are the time was mostly a European-dominated entity. These two aspects greatly reduced Arab, or non-jewish consultation during Partition Talks. I believe that this is one of reasons why Arab Nations, and the Arabs within partitioned Palestine/Israel decided to invade in 1947/1948. Again, the British had to decolonize their former holdings and just left, with all of their military (which were holding the peace) after the partition was finalized.

There are radical sects of both Arab/Palestine Nationalist groups and Zionist Nationalist groups. If you want a two state solution than these extremist/terrorist groups need to be dissolved or less the cycle of violence will just continue. These extremist political groups are the main barrier to a two state solution, there have been documented examples of extremist groups from both sides sabotaging peace talks. Radical sects like Hamas are the enemy of normalization, just as some far right zionist groups are. I have never seen this conflict as black and white, there are bad actors on both sides. 

Yesterday was awful, truly awful. I fully expect the IDF to invade Gaza and systematically root out Hamas. I think it is warranted as Hamas is the elected political party in Gaza. I am not sure what Israel will do with the inhabitants of Gaza, there are 2 million people there. Maybe it will be administered similarly to how the West Bank is. I think this will lead to a walking back of normalization of relations between other Middle Eastern Countries and Israel. Depending on the US's involvement, this could lead to another 1973 energy crisis. Though I am not sure how likely that is, but it is possible. 

I think as time goes on, it becomes less and less likely of a two state solution. I think it is the best solution still. Hamas does not represent the collective Palestinian opinion, it is a fringe extremist group. I do think it is inevitable that Palestinians (especially in Gaza) will radicalize and the cycle will continue unless something changes. However, is compromise something that people are interested in, I am talking from both sides. I don't think so.

If people are interested in this subject, I would highly recommend listening to the Matyrmade Podcast series on the history of Palestine/Israel leading up to 1947.

Thinking they do is the same islamophobia that was rampant in the US after 9/11 when people acted like Al-Qaeda represented all Muslims. Hamas has obviously done some horrible horrible things. They need to be stopped. But they do not represent all Palestinians

Israel also isn’t innocent. They have bullied  Palestine for 75 years. They have done a lot of awful things during that time. They have filled wells that Palestinians used for water with concrete, they have raided mosques for no reason. They have committed war crimes against them. For example: in 2009 Israel used white phosphorus against civilians in Gaza. If you don’t know, white phosphorus is an incendiary munition. When it contacts air, not only does it ignite, but it immediately covers everything in smoke. In addition to the burning it can also cause brain injuries, but it also sticks to skin and clothes. The use of it near civilians is illegal and therefore it is a war crime to use it like Israel did. And now they’re killing Palestinian civilians just like Hamas is doing

Neither side in this is even remotely innocent. Hamas absolutely needs to go, but Israel also needs to cease what they’ve done. Only then can peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis happen

297,"The history of Israel covers an area of the Southern Levant also known as Canaan, Palestine or the Holy Land, which is the geographical location of the modern states of Israel and Palestine. From a prehistory as part of the critical Levantine corridor, which witnessed waves of early humans out of Africa, to the emergence of Natufian culture c. 10th millennium BCE, the region entered the Bronze Age c. 2,000 BCE with the development of Canaanite civilization, before being vassalized by Egypt in the Late Bronze Age. In the Iron Age, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were established, entities that were central to the origins of the Jewish and Samaritan peoples as well as the Abrahamic faith tradition.This has given rise to Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, Druzism, Baha'ism, and a variety of other religious movements. Throughout the course of human history, the Land of Israel has come under the sway or control of various polities, and as a result, it has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups.

In the following centuries, the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian Empires conquered the region. The Ptolemies and the Seleucids vied for control over the region during the Hellenistic period. However, with the establishment of the Hasmonean dynasty, the local Jewish population maintained independence for a century before being incorporated into the Roman Republic.As a result of the Jewish-Roman Wars in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, many Jews were killed, displaced or sold into slavery.Following the advent of Christianity, which was adopted by the Greco-Roman world under the influence of the Roman Empire, the region's demographics shifted towards newfound Christians, who replaced Jews as the majority of the population by the 4th century. However, shortly after Islam was consolidated across the Arabian Peninsula under Muhammad, Byzantine Christian rule over the Land of Israel was superseded by the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century. From the 11th century to the 13th century, the Land of Israel became the centre for intermittent religious wars between Christian and Muslim armies as part of the Crusades. In the 13th century, the Land of Israel became subject to the Mongol invasions and conquests, though these were locally routed by the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule it remained until the 16th century. The Mamluks were eventually defeated by the Ottoman Empire, and the region became an Ottoman province until the 20th century.

The late 19th century saw the widespread consolidation of a Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism, as part of which aliyah (Jewish return to the Land of Israel from the diaspora) increased. During World War I, the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the Allies led to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Britain was granted control of the region by League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine. The British government publicly committed itself to the creation of a Jewish homeland. Arab nationalism opposed this design, asserting Arab rights over the former Ottoman territories and seeking to prevent Jewish migration. As a result, Arab–Jewish tensions grew in the succeeding decades of British administration.

Israel was never Palestines in the first place. People need to look at history before making assumptions.

A decent number of Muslims will blindly defend Muslims no matter what. Again not saying good or bad, just the way it is. They have a concept called ""ummah"" where they believe all Muslims are part of the same ummah. Correct me if I am wrong, the ummah transcend all race, national ties, etc. It is meant to unify Muslims under one religious banner. So because of this, Muslims have a sense of community like no other religion. 

This, combined with regular intake of propaganda that dehumanizes the ""enemy"", makes Muslims support other Muslims no matter what and they cannot see wrong in what other Muslims actions.

Once again, not all Muslims live by this or are like this, just a decent number of them do. Like I said, for the community of Muslims, it has it's positive perks for them and negative perks for them/others sometimes. Just how it is.

For the rest, who lack the world wisdom, emotional restraint, and/or social status to *not* agree with and support Palestinian Muslim Arab violence, I pray for you, and better luck next lifetime.

But I get where their anger is coming from, and I relate to it. And as a result, I don’t have it in me to condemn their actions.”**

It doesn’t help that some groups immediately jumped to “Israel started it” rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don’t understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. 
I sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas’ shoulders. I just wish I saw more Palestinian voices speaking out and decrying what took place/ condemning Hamas. Entirely possible I just haven’t seen those voices. 

Full Disclosure: this is my raw opinion on the matter, only got up to speed today on everything going on. I’m not saying this is 100% correct so if you have anything to add or correct, please feel free.",2023-10-09 20:10:50
427,"regardless of who you ""support,"" the terrorists have committed heinous acts. If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn't listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace.",2023-10-09 13:06:45

Until I spoke to someone who lived through apartheid in South Africa and realised that for a nation who is fighting a settler/occupying force who subjugate them consistently, the occupied people do not consider these groups as terrorists(as I understand it Hamas is one of those). They see them as liberators or resistance forces. Even the ANC in South Africa who lead the movement against the apartheid regime used violent force when they had too. I later found out that there's a UN resolution(3246 (XXIX)) that allows any occupied people/nation to resist their occupiers by any means necessary including armed struggle. Considering that isreal consider themselves as an ethno-nationalist state(the occupiers), to say that they have the right self defend themselves but that the Palestinians(the occupied) don't have the right to self defence and they get branded as terrorist if they do so sounds quite odd and unfair to me.

1. **Political Context**:  Hamas has both political and militant wings. While some countries, including the United States and Israel, designate it as a terrorist organization, others do not. Some nations and entities view Hamas as a legitimate political entity representing the Palestinian people.

2. **Historical Background**:  Hamas was formed in the late 1980s in response to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. It evolved from a grassroots movement seeking to resist occupation.

3. **Election and Governance**: Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, gaining legitimacy as a political entity. This shows that it has a level of popular support within the Palestinian territories.

4. **Ceasefire and Negotiations**: various times, Hamas has expressed willingness to engage in ceasefire agreements with Israel, indicating a potential shift towards a more diplomatic approach.

5. **Critique of Israeli Policies**: Some critics contend that labeling Hamas as solely a terrorist group can overlook underlying issues, such as the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the socio-economic challenges faced by Palestinians.

6. **Humanitarian Perspective**:  The impact of Israeli policies on the lives of Palestinians, and how this can lead to support for Hamas as a resistance force.

In April, Zionist settlers attacked the Al-Aqua mosque.   Nothing was done to prevent future attacks.  Perhaps Netanyahu was focused on more on his undemocratic power grap than on peace or security.

Then, on September 17:

It looks like Hamas organized their limited forces brilliantly, and with a secrecy that is a credit to their resolve, determination, and unity.

It’s not a great vibe in America to look at where this problem sort of went.  Today these lands and reservations are quite backward.   US rarely cared about the troubles of these folks and today they either assimilate or struggle on the Rez. 

I expect in another 200 years Palestine will likely be in a similar place.  My advice would be to look at what happens to weaker nations especially those that struggle to make strong alliances which clearly Palestine suffers from as well. 
- even stronger nations can cause the rest of the world to rise up against them… but let’s be honest the imperial empire isn’t something Israel is looking to establish.  They just want their little New Jersey sized space to continue to lead the world in many areas.

594,"I’m an American. We had a similar situation play out on September 11th, 2001; when hijackers flew two commercial airliners into the largest towers in America in New York City, as well as the Pentagon — a government agency/building. This was an act committed by Islamic extremists, following the command of Osama bin Laden; the leader of Al Quaeda.

Many lost their lives that day, whether from direct impact from the planes, smoke inhalation, the towers collapsing, or those that decided to take their own lives rather than burn in the flames attacking the buildings. We hated after that. We hated anyone we could get our hands on, shifting the blame not only to various countries, not just to Muslims, but to Arabs as a whole.

We spent 20 years hating them for what they did, and we hunted them down and killed them. We killed their followers, their competitors, their successors, and their allies — and we paid back the blood from that day a thousand times over.

From that experience, I will tell you this. I’m sorry. It hurts, I know it does. It won’t get better or easier any time soon, and I won’t lie to you and tell you it will. But what I will say is this:

*Don’t let hate consume you.*

Hate Islam, hate Hamas, but don’t hate everyone around you. Don’t shift the blame until you can barely tell who really attacked who or when. Don’t go overboard, you won’t come back up for a long time if you do. Don’t hate your neighbors, hate those that support these deplorable acts, and hate those that committed them. Nobody else.

If there is a God or Gods, may They watch over you and give both you and your friends peace — and may your roads lead always to good company and prosperity.",2023-10-07 17:23:54

630,"Hamas is centered in Gaza. Hamas has been the government there for over 15 years after massacring the opposition. Fatah. Fatah wanted two separate states. Hamas reason d'etre is to wipe Israel from the map to bring about Judgement day.

How do you know this? Hamas has in its chartered mandate to a) wipe out the state of Israel and b) in the process, kill any Jews that remain. 

Hamas regularly and systematically murders any dissidents who support an Israeli state. 

Hamas purposefully launches its attacks from schools and hospital roofs so that any counterattack results in maximum civilian casualties. The goal of this is to break down peace talks (it already worked to break down the Abraham Accords). 

Thus, Hamas is at its very core a terrorist organization equivalent to ISIS and similar. 

Israel cannot let this continue and thus has said ""get out of Gaza, we are coming"". Aid is also available upon the release of prisoners. Of course, Israel knows that Hamas will not release them, and in fact wants its people to suffer to create outrage with other Muslim communities.

World War II: The US, to save military lives, dropped two atomic bombs with an enemy that undoubtedly would have surrendered. 

Israel is facing a much more radical enemy, and for 1 week dropped bombs with warning dummy missiles and cut off supplies. Israel's response has been far more constrained.

As in, they are not comparable. Full disclosure: Not Israeli, not Jewish, not religious.",2023-10-13 15:41:00

632,"Yes, everyone is taking crazy pills, so to speak. Or rather. What you are seeing is the result of several things -- algorithmic bias pushing extreme takes both now and for years -- an increasing us vs them mentality all over the world from all sides - the proliferation of worldviews that see all things as a matter of a good guy and a bad guy in black and white terms that tends to happen during periods of crisis and uncertainty which the past decade absolutely has been for everyone.

Both sides ALSO have both overt and covert, direct and indirect propaganda campaigns at work. There are a lot of people with a strong agenda to make this as simple and onesided as possible.

You also have third party actors who have been running campaigns to increase division and keep the conversation as hostile as possible -- think about the bot farms found to trying to exacerbate tensions in the US and UK -- posting extremes on both sides not for a specific outcome but just for the tension and division. They're here too.

You are also seeing deeply held convictions and anger. In the middle of extreme events, people often adopt a strong ""if you are not with us you are against us"" position. Super hate that anyone older than 25 will know that line from Bush post 9/11 and act like thats the first time it was uttered but it sure was a time it was uttered. What the US did post 9/11 needs to STOP coming up, just as I wish people would stop bringing up other conflicts, present and past.

You also have a lot of people glibly playing this like a rhetorical game instead of the disaster and loss of life it is. These people are not worth your time to try to communicate with and yet they get a lot of views. Backseat generals and war spectators have always existed.

This situation is incredibly complicated. Complicated things are mangled the most in attempts to communicate.

The online space, specifically, has fallen into this pattern of trying to read into what people DON'T say and attack for that. What's that tweet -- if you say ""I like pancakes"" someone will say ""SO YOU DON'T LIKE WAFFLES THEN"". Except you know, with horrific human suffering and complex geopolitics.

A lot of people are casual tourists in activism and reactivism. They don't know the context, but they feel they have a firm belief in justice. A lot of them are jumping in off all the info they're getting from the situation above.

All that being said. You also have a situation where you can't just say ""They should just stop."" And people will get upset at you for saying ""what if no violence"" without understanding the reasons for the violence. Saying ""no violence"" in the middle of an exchange of violence doesn't go over well.

For what its worth, you can and should be heartbroken and horrified by the death of innocents. And people are trying to harden their hearts against one side for a variety of reasons. Sure could right a lot about the context of that phrase but... this post is too long

But you can hold the suffering of innocents in your heart and be horrified and still come away with different ""so what now"" positions. many people do. And are. They do not rise to the top. And they get attacked for the reasons above.

There are diversities of thought, but they are hard to find. There are literal families of the victims begging for peace. You have to remember most people in Gaza right now are without an ability to post their pleas - you're seeing the people who have outsider cameras pointed at them, motivated by all the above.

I've written a lot and still not given you even most of it.

TLDR -- extreme positions rise algorithmically to the top, tensions and passions are high, nuance is the first casualty of war, people will read more into any statement you make because other people are hiding behind those statements, and ""the death of innocents is bad"" is not a policy or course of action proposal.

More people agree with you than it appears. Don't lose your compassion. But compassion itself is not a course of action. Thats what makes this complicated.",2023-10-13 17:43:25

Right now you're caught between two rioting, torch carrying, lynch mobs. There is no reason in those types. So block out the noise for the time being and stick with fact only sources. Task and Purpose (YouTube channel) seems to have a pretty cool head about it. Ward Carol (also Youtube) as well. Clinical detachment right now is most important. 


This war is a hard one because there is no good guy. Just bad guys and the innocents caught between them.  But if you support the innocents then both mobs will pounce on you.

How can it be unjustifiable? It's the only solution to stop the killing of innocent Israelis. What you're saying is Israel doesn't have a right to self-defense. It needs to tie its own hands and fight Hamas like that. That's not how any war in history has ever been won. Unless Israel specifically targets civilians, or kills a severe number of civilians without reasonable military targets.... any collateral damage is acceptable to achieve the self-defense objective of eliminating Hamas. Every single life lost is a tragedy and the blood is on the hands of Hamas, the people who support it and elected it. The sad state of affair is, the only solution to this conflict is eliminating the evil side because you can't compromise with pure evil. The only one who has it in their power to save Palestinians now is Hamas: the only moral thing for them to do now is to surrender and release the hostages. This is what we need to call for. Every time Israel drops a bomb it is because the assholes of Hamas have not surrendered yet",2023-10-27 04:24:24

**War is brutal, and sometimes things happen that no one wants to happen.** Even countries that claim to follow international law and say they should not kill innocent civilians have been forced to do so in war. For example, during World War II, both the United States and the United Kingdom intentionally bombed civilian populations in Germany. The cities of Cologne, Hamburg, and Dresden were completely destroyed, and tens of thousands of innocent children and women were killed.

**When a country is losing a war, it may retaliate in ways that are beyond the laws of war.** For example, the United States spent billions of dollars on the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The purpose of this weapon was not to kill German soldiers, but to kill as many civilians as possible. This weapon was eventually used to destroy the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over a quarter of a million people.

**It is important to remember that all countries have committed atrocities in war.** Those who point fingers at others should be aware of their own history. For example, the United States has a long history of using violence against civilians, including the use of atomic bombs, napalm, and drone strikes.",2023-10-14 06:30:46

I don't think your two solicited points conflict, but I do actually reject that the siege and bombing is unjustifiable. If the minimum apparent and realistic option it would take to neutralize Hamas given a reasonable amount of finance and time still involves the unfortunate deaths of a large amount of civilians, Israelis are not improper in taking this option. Civilian deaths do not make the destruction of materiel a crime.

To your knowledge israel is the country that puts effort like no other country on the planet in trying not to hurt the non- involved. Unfortunately to the really innocent, hamas has decided to use them as human shields.


2 million people were just asked by Israel to leave their homes so they don't get hurt when bombing Hamas targets, and while Hamas tires to convince everyone to stay, all you hear from the people in gaza are complaints towards israel.


7.8 million people left their homes in Syria in the process of getting rid of ISIS, and you did not hear citizens being interviewed complaining about the coalition fighting against ISIS - this tells you all you need to know --- 


HAMAS DOES NOT CARE for the lives of the citizens in gaza, and the citizens in gaza are at least not happy to cooperate with getting rid of this ISIS-like terror group.

Thousands of those ""innocent"" people actively participated in the murder, rape, abuse and  kidnapping of hundreds of Israelis. 

Another interesting piece of information: Hamas is in fact (yes, the same group now everyone is trying to differ from the ""free Palestine"" movement)
 the most popular party among palestinians - with a 54% support rate among all Palestinians - according to studied done - and this includes Palestinians outside of gaza (where Abbas in in charge), when part of Hamas's manifest is that every jew (yes, jew, not israeli) should be killed . 

This means if today, Palestine would have democratic elections - this Palestinian ISIS would WIN BY A MILE (14% to Abbas) - this tells you all you need to know.

Giving 1 million people 24 hrs to evacuate is also cruel and almost impossible. Forcing them not to evacuate, as Hamas is doing, is also cruel and evil.

Are you angry with them for invading and abusing countries in eastern Australia and Africa and hiring people as slaves? Are you angry with China or Russia for occupying territories? Why not? And I will tell you two things. Other countries in the world did this for money, resources and power, while the Jews sought refuge, for them the search for a state was survival because they were massacred and persecuted in exile. You are also not angry because everything is a thing of the past, the world strives for progress and enlightenment and so do all the countries I mentioned, and so should we all. In addition, I must mention a significant historical accuracy that distinguishes between the cases - there was no occupation here!! The country was in the hands of the Ottomans, then in the hands of the British Mandate. The British government offered the two nations (!) to establish a state here, half and half, and only the Jews agreed to the division. There was no occupation. Before the State of Israel was established, there were both Jews and Arabs in Israel, check me out. And I agree with the fact that the country should be democratic and respond to both peoples, or it should be divided and the two peoples will live side by side with respect. But please, I'm begging you, as you determine what was here and what wasn't, check!! Find your information in a reliable place, please! Misinformation spreads on the Internet like wildfire, and it is important to verify it before we spread it ourselves and hurt people. I am in favor of the people in Gaza being well, and that the money and aid that other countries and the Israeli states transfer to them will reach the citizens. But unfortunately Hamas controls them and takes their money to carry out terrorism. Terrorism at the expense of their own citizens. Think what Gaza could be, so much money and help, they could be the next startup nation! Develop and promote the citizens! Hamas leaves the citizens with nothing! And in Israel they try to help, we, I, the taxpayers in Israel, pay them water and electricity, we bought them corona vaccines and helped treat the sick. Israel wants Gaza to develop and we will live side by side in peace!! That's what I want!! Please really check, come here, and see that everything I write is correct. And please, please don't justify the murder of innocent people. In Israel, they don't just bomb innocent people - check me, really check - Israel only harms Hamas, which deliberately builds its headquarters in private buildings. Why? Israel always sends a warning - ""knock on the door"" so that the citizens know to flee before they damage Hamas positions. Check me out. In this operation, there were several attacks in which Israel did not warn, so that members of Hamas would not run away either. And almost, they issued a warning to many residents in Gaza to evacuate before an attack because they do not want to harm them. Did Hamas do this? Did he aim his many rockets at a specific location or shoot babies, elderly people and animals from point blank range? And if you so much want Israel to belong entirely to the Palestinians, what do you propose to do with us? After all, we were born here, to this life, to this country. what should we do? Will we be deported to another country and go through a holocaust again? where shall we go? Don't forget - most of us are just ordinary people. For example, I am a student. I don't consider myself a Jew at all, but an atheist for that matter. My dream is to save the planet and travel the world. My energies are more or less invested in this. Do I deserve to die?

The Israeli military onslaught has manifested in a devastating toll of civilian casualties, with over 4,000 children killed since October 7, 2023. A narrative that veers towards false equivalences and misplaced blame is not only misleading but grotesquely distorts the grim reality on the ground.

The message at hand showcases a disturbing trend of false equivalences, attempting to paint both sides of the conflict with the same brush of genocidal intent. This distortion veils the stark, undeniable difference in military capabilities and the ensuing devastation, which is apparent for the world to see. The lopsided death toll, especially the heart-wrenching death toll of children in Gaza, stands as a bitter testament to the disproportionate violence inflicted upon the Palestinians.

The siege on Gaza has indiscriminately ripped through residential areas, obliterating homes, schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure. The numbers of women, children, and elderly among the injured and deceased are staggering, a blatant testament to the merciless nature of the Israeli military's bombing campaign. The discourse that attempts to draw an equivalence between the actions of an organized military power and groups resisting occupation is a dangerous fallacy that overlooks this glaring asymmetry of power and violence.

The insinuations against Palestinians as 'barbarians' is a dehumanizing rhetoric that fuels the fire of hatred and ignorance, diverting attention from the core issue of oppression and indiscriminate violence ravaging Gaza. The demand for acknowledging two 'bad' entities as if they stand on equal footing in terms of power and international backing is a gross simplification of a complex and deeply entrenched conflict.

The true insanity lies in the inability or unwillingness of certain factions to recognize the oppressive forces at play and the calamitous impact it has on the lives of ordinary Palestinians. The call of the hour is not to indulge in baseless comparisons but to unequivocally condemn the unjustifiable violence and work towards a just resolution that upholds the dignity and rights of all individuals embroiled in this conflict.

International bodies and nations worldwide must pierce through the smoke of misleading narratives, unequivocally condemn the ongoing atrocities, demand an immediate cessation of violence, and work tirelessly to provide urgent humanitarian aid to the affected population.

All are leaving out crucial details and happenings that make a messy thing messier, there's no wholly moral ""winning"" move in this conflict.

Recent events are a combination of thousands of years of history, religious conflict, governmental corruption and power plays, hundreds of years of distrust. Terrorism, manipulation, geopolitics, geopolitical power plays, moral politics, side taking, information wars, willful ignorance, ignored responsibility, settlement bullshittery, a lack of oversight and unregulated support.

I say this as a humanitarian person, and someone who previously and still sorta does support the Palestinian people, at least in theory. Reality doesn't support a good end.

It is ignorant to blindly support the Palestinian people if they wont eject Hamas, if they actively support them, parading around corpses of israli's and tourists, of children, women and elderly, allow them to tunnel under their neighborhoods and fire rockets and mortars at israel.

Hamas hides within the civilian population, and the population doesn't eject them or fight them. Hamas has a proven track record of turning humanitarian aid and foreign provided infrastructure to make weapons and money, to run a war against Jewish people in proxy of ethno-states themselves in proxy to larger war and chaos waging nations. Israel has no responsibility to protect a people who would rather see them dead, and yet for years they have provided them with power, water, food, and electricity, and even work.

Israel drop leaflets to encourage evacuation or at the least sheltering when they have finally been forced to go in, and Hamas tells the people to stay. Not that there's actually anywhere to go.  Israel provides warnings for the airstrikes, and Hamas tells them to stay, and they stay, while they themselves flee like rats to their tunnels to fire more rockets from hospitals, schools, refugee camps, and places of worship.

I think it's also rather telling that not one nation, not even those supplying Hamas weapons, nor those supplying humanitarian aid, or those that allow them to openly smuggle weapons in through their territory actually wants to take the Palestinian people in, for a variety of reasons including the population being traumatized into contentiousness, meanwhile Palestinian expats and refugees(not all, obviously) actively call for the deaths of israeli's and jews in their host nations, threaten places of worship and people on the streets.

In 1955, Algerian independence guerrillas attacked the French settler community of Philippeville, massacring all the settlers they found (men and children were slaughtered with knives or beheaded, pregnant women were disembowelled, etc.).
The killings were brutal and indiscriminate: the Algerian insurgents killed in totally random way and executed racist and brutal French settlers who mistreated the indigenous people, along with innocent women or children who had no guilt.

The massacre had been carried out by Algerian independence guerrillas with the idea of ​​exasperating French colonists and soldiers, who became even more racist than before and carried out mass executions of Algerian civilians accused of the attacks.

It does seem unnecessarily cruel to civilians.

On the other hand we have not seen the fighting inside Gaza yet, and perhaps it is necessary to avoid too many casualties on the defender's side.

In every war, bombing campaigns were used by both sides.

What do the rules say if one side fights a war ENTIRELY via targeting civilians...are you really suppose to tip-toe around all your opponent's civilian populations who democratically elected their war-crime-happy government?

Then the other side is reluctantly breaking a few rules.

If you haven't lived under the oppression of the IDF and haven't suffered the losses of children, brother/sisters, mothers/fathers and so on then you have the luxury of being able to think that.

For the people actually on the ground though, they have seen first hand the carnage wrought and it is seared into their very being. Since 2008 and up until just prior to the current conflict Palestinian civilians have suffered **3,803** fatalities while Israeli civilian fatalities were **177**. That is not a typo. And that's only fatalities. That's not to mention all tens of thousands of people injured and maimed, with many never to fully recover. Then consider that Gaza has been under a brutal blockade for 17 years.

Source: [https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#)

No nation or body of people could look at those figures and say ""Well my adversary has killed 3,800 of our civilians while we've killed 177 of them. That's perfectly fine!"" What do they have to show for their restraint? How does that comport to the idea of proportionality in warfare? Israel accuses their enemies of using human shields, but the word shield implies some sort of protection. A protection that is non-existent as the IDF has shown virtually no restraint in bombing targets that result in massive civilian death tolls including those of women and children.

*So you're suggesting Israel can't defend itself?*

Imagine if an attempted bank robbery that turned into a hostage situation occurred in your country. And imagine that instead of negotiating or storming the building with small arms equipped soldiers, your police department called in an airstrike killing hostage and perpetrator alike. Would that be an acceptable outcome? Are those the actions of a responsible government?

*They aren't* ***my*** *civilians and besides they voted for Hamas*

Hamas was voted in in 2006 with 76% voter turnout. They campaigned not as Hamas but as the **Change and Reform** party. Out of those that voted, 45% voted for Hamas and polls conducted after the election indicated that the main reason they voted them in was not to escalate with Israel but rather to combat corruption. In fact, 79.5% were in favor of pursuing a peace agreement with Israel. That translates to a lot of civilians who either didn't vote for Hamas or wanted nothing to do with the extremist ideology.

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006\_Palestinian\_legislative\_election#Opinion\_polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election#Opinion_polls)

Hamas has not held elections since then and thanks to meddling from GW Bush and co., Hamas took control of the Gaza strip. In fact, had GW Bush not pressed for elections back in 2006 Hamas may have never taken control.

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006\_Palestinian\_legislative\_election#US\_post-election\_impediments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election#US_post-election_impediments)

While it is true that Hamas in Gaza enjoys about 45% support based on a [March 2023 survey](https://pcpsr.org/en/node/938) it's important to note that **half the Gazan population is 19 or younger**. That means that 50% of the population was only 4 years old or younger when the elections took place and therefore **they never had any say in the current government** and all they know is life under the blockade.

*Israel is the more responsible party because they use ""knocking"" before bombing*

Israel's use of knocking in the current conflict appears to be vastly reduced from prior conflicts:

More importantly, roof knocking is not designed to reduce casualties, but rather to make Israel's slaughter of civilians appear more palpable to western audiences. The truth is the roof knocking was not an effective tactic. Sometimes the ""knock"" round missed the final target and those times when the warning munitions did hit they were often misinterpreted or mistaken in the cacophony of bursting munitions that civilians had to endure. Even during times when civilians did correctly interpret the message they could have as little as 5 minutes to evacuate before the killing blow was delivered. (warnings were estimated to have proceed bombings anywhere from 5-45 minutes)

Source: [https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/22/u-n-israeli-roof-knocks-did-not-provide-effective-warning-to-gaza-civilians/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/22/u-n-israeli-roof-knocks-did-not-provide-effective-warning-to-gaza-civilians/)

Also consider that in Israel virtually all citizens are mandated to serve in the military meaning these are not ordinary civilians. When the US used nukes to bomb Japan in WW2, one of the justifications cited was that in the event of invasion the Japanese population would be mobilized and militarized. Israel is a militarized society.

Furthermore, the rules of warfare are only as relevant as

A) both participants largely adhere to them

B) those rules are fair to the participants

As the civilian casualty figures show and as they freely admit now, Israel has nothing but contempt for the rules of war:

*Gallant said that he had ordered “a complete siege of the Gaza Strip,” which is home to 2.2 million Palestinians, nearly half of them children. “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” he said. “We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.”*

*What Gallant ordered — the collective punishment of a civilian population — amounts to a war crime under international law, as well as potentially a crime against humanity and the crime of genocide, some international law experts have pointed out.*

And most of the hate is on Israel nonetheless? 
How much hate can you have to not stop and acknowledge this unfathomable atrocity? 
People were forced out of their homes put in a line and shot to death, they cuffed children to one another , put them in a room and threw a grenade inside.

The Holocaust is one of the single worst events that have happened to an entire race. Yet there is not enough empathy and maturity in the world to make people stop joking about the word jew.

In between dozens of videos proofing Hamas killed children, babies, elderlies they put a propaganda declaration that Hamas never killed any civilians.
They even see their ruthless slaughter of civilians as an act of defense.

In my opinion it is a waste of time talking to such people, as you cannot trust their words. They are also incapable of understanding that it is their fault tens of thousands in Gaza will die in the upcoming weeks.

Acknowledging that children on  the Gaza side also don't deserve to die as a result of the atrociteis of Hamas or your anguish does not mean we support a terrorist organization.

What did Israel think would happen to those children when they grew up? Having land forcibly taken from them at whim, earth moving machines appearing and then being forced to move to an overpopulated ghetto. 

The people who got murdered at their Kibutzniks, are not entirely innocent in that they have chosen to be settlers. To occupy contested land and as everyone knows, the settlers are given financial aid. I have 100% Jewish roots, and I haven’t even visited Israel- because I cannot bring myself to. Having grown up in apartheid South Africa I cannot face to witness those injustices.

838,"The part that’s hard for me to stomach is the twisted irony of it.  Centuries upon centuries of Jewish oppression due to slander like the blood libel, and mandates like from the Council of Trent, all culminating in one of the most depraved crimes against humanity in history during WWII.    

The same diaspora that suffered the Shoah also gave the Palestinians the Nakba.  I’m not absolving Egypt and Jordan of their role in this, but let’s not pretend that Israel has not been the main perpetrator for the past several decades.  700,000 displaced, hundreds of villages and urban areas destroyed.  People have lived their whole lives in refugee camps like Jenin, and what has Israel seriously done to help and integrate the population since it came under occupation in ‘67?

The whole world can see that the Palestinians are living under an apartheid state.  Zionist settlers murder in the West Bank to take land and homes, and there is no recourse for the victims there.  This is one of the major sources of the current conflict, and what has the Israeli government done to diffuse the situation?  Ben-Gvir, your minister of national security, called them heroes!  Just this past June, I seem to recall, he made a statement saying that the military has settlers’ backs when they ‘storm the hills’.  The Knesset is full of far-right ghouls who use real and invented antisemitism to justify heinous acts against a largely defenseless people.  The cycle of violence will end only when both sides accept their wrongs and WORK towards peace!  This planned ground invasion will create no meaningful change in relations, only a river of blood.

edit:  I, personally, and most rational people I imagine have no problem with Israel rooting out Hamas terrorists.  That’s understandable and just, but you cannot claim it’s just self defense when the state is largely responsible for creating and engendering the conditions that cause a group like Hamas to grow and thrive, and then accept civilian casualties as collateral damage in the fight against them.

I think HAMAS is terrible for what they did to the Israelites. There's a video I saw of a woman behind a pickup truck and her legs arms were bent upside down and every Palestinian in the video spat on her corpse, it was very awful and sad and it made me angry when I taught to myself if that was my girlfriend, how sad and unfair it would be to see somebody that you love be turned into an object that all these people treat like trash.

But when I learn about the conditions that the people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have suffered for the last decades, and I look at the conditions they live in now and how they are treated as second class citizens in Israel I start the sympathize also with the Palestinians. Palestinians in Gaza are not able to do trade with other nations, their water and power are controlled by Israel, Netanyahu has increased settlements in the West Bank, increased police military presence in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians have a 50% unemployment, and the Palestinians has suffered way more [causalities](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987) over the course of this war than Israel. 

Israel is a world power that has  a top three intelligence agency, nuclear weapons, and international aid from power allies while Palestine is barely a country with no army, no electricity, and no water. Israel are the bigger person in this dynamic, they should act like it. I think what they should do is bargain for the hostages and put up walls around the Gaza strip and the West Bank.

Gaza is often described as the largest open-air prison in the world, and the recent lack of access to basic necessities like water and electricity, combined with ongoing bombings, highlights the urgency of supporting the Palestinian cause.

&#x200B;

It is important to acknowledge that there are civilians on both sides who genuinely desire peace.

871,"I think Israel got played. They went dark enough, evil enough and Machiavellian enough to force a dead-end move by Israel. Saturday was the start of a 50 year war that can be won by no one.  


In a book there is a description of the 9th circle of hell where the ground is frozen and people are entombed in it. At the center is Hitler and Stalin, each grabbing the other by the hair and shoulder, raking deep bloody groves into the skin and flesh of the other. Their eyes are bulging, their mouths are frozen in an open scream which has been silenced by the ice in which they are submerged, and their faces are contorted with hatred.  


Now the thing is that though they are stuck in the ice, over time they can move. So if either one would release the other, both could make it out of the ice. But they don't. The hate is too strong and the lust for vengeance is overpowering all other emotion or consideration. They are each other's captives but each is also the warden of their own prison.  


I know the parallel is not the same. Israel is no Stalin analogue. But you have to admit that not every punitive policy Israel has enacted since 1946 has been necessary as a political or military strategic action. And I also know that the hardest thing about this issue is that this is not a 50/50 issue like that of Hitler and Stalin in the ice. It's more like 70/30 or 80/20. But none the less, fair or not, they hold each other in the ice. Even if in the end Israel can never escape the ice, only Palestine.  


Obviously I do not advocate Israel to simply lie down and die, allowing a strong Palestine state to slaughter their people. Never. I would never ever say that. What I am advocating is not to do what they're about to do because it will lead to disaster. Find another way. Find an alternative. Anything.

The irony of Israels defence is insane, Israel is an Apartheid state of racism, living in what may as well be an open air prison against a state that firmly grips the water, food, electricity supply a long with restricting what enters and exits, conducting frequent raids, bombings, dehumanisation tactics, censoring pro Palestinian views on social media and news outlets then they act all innocent when the Palestinians fight back? There are baby's in incubators in gaza right now that will need to be turned off due to Israel's shutting down of power, along with multiple videos of Israel's bombing campaign killing scores of children, what israels doing is not defense if they wanted to defend themselves they would fight Hamas on the ground and by tactical elimination not blowing up half of gaza an area which may I remind u is one of the most densely populated on earth? Using white phosphorus on civilian areas something outlawed by the UN for being inhumane the attacks on Israel where a direct consequence of Israel's decades of tyranny something that would need a entire book to go over there countless acts of discrimination, racism, and downright genocide, the most tear gassed place on planet earth is the Aida Palestinian refugee camp in the west bank a small densely populated camp of majority women and children. Does this sound like self defense? Or the acts of a state that wants a ""two state system"" a camp where mothers are forced to seal their infants in closets while clouds of tear gas saturate their shelter? Just to show the discrepancy between 2008 and 2021 for every 1 Israeli death 23 Palestinians were killed over the same time period 121,438 Palestinians were injured to a mere 5,682 injured Israelis that doesn't even factor in the fact that on the Israeli side most injured or killed we're soldiers while on the Palestinian it was majority civilian deaths, there are between 600,000and 750,000 illegal Israeli settlers living in the occupied west bank and east Jerusalem settlement that is illegal under international law this doesn't even start on the blatant racism even against Palestinians who are citizens of Israel who despite holding Israeli citizenship face several dozen laws discriminating against them from education, housing, politician participation, due process making them second and third class citizens in their own country lest we forget Jerusalem which Israel claims as it's undivided capital that just so happens to have a 700km concrete wall physically separating more then 140,000 Palestinians from jews. On top of all this there are the over 700 checkpoints that severely limit Palestinian movement having to wait hours travelling along segregated road networks where Israelis can pass freely. All of what I have stated is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Israels systemic abuse of Palestinians that has been going on for decades with the Palestinians crys for help falling on deaf ears leading them to a point of desperation culminating in the Hamas attacks on oct 7. If after all this u still believe these attacks were unfounded or motivated purely by hate u are doing nothing but denying the clear truth.",2023-10-14 04:40:02

However, you cannot say that Palestine is behind this. It was Hamas, a group of people that are hated by the majority of the Gazans because of their corruption. The only thing they wanted, was creating a shock wave, so Israel would retaliate. Retaliation will also mean a lot of innocents deaths from Palestinian side which is a given when you go to war. This lose of innocent lives will anger a lot of Palestinians, which pushes them to the side of Hamas. War is the only way how Hamas can survive, since that is the only thing they can. They are worthless rulers and are hated for that.

It is a downward spiral that will not end and will continue, unless we change something. Change is possible when we would stop polarize everything. Hamas is a terror organization and should be wiped out of the world. Only a part of Palestinians are Hamas, so don't generalize and don't say they deserve to die because someone else did something. 

The same holds for Israel. Most of the Israelis are peaceful people who just want to live a happy life. However, there are groups in Israel that want to expand Israel by annexing land that was of Palestinian families for generations. That are also bad people, but that is not an excuse to harm any innocent Israeli.

I shared it before, but here we go again

Short after [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Balfour\_declaration\_unmarked.jpg): The British promise for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”, a paramilitary organization called Haganah was created to achieve this promise. Its original purpose was to defend Jewish settlements, from the Liberation movement of Arabs who were living in what was then Mandate Palestine.

Despite being an armed force, restraint was a strategic policy used by the Haganah members with regard to their activities, and they weren't really that radical.

This Changed When The British Government issued the [White paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_Paper\_of\_1939), which severely slowed down Jewish settlement in Palestine.

As a Reaction, Haganah Turned to bombing and sabotage (In 1940 a Haganah bomb sunk the ocean liner SS Patria, killing 267 people).


After Israel declared its independence, Haganah was dissolved and basically became the core of the IDF.


But going a few steps back, Haganah's restraint policy was objected to by the most radical and extremist members because it appeared defeatist to them. These radicals split off and formed the group Irgun, and from this one split off another group Called Lehi.


Irgun with a symbol of [hand holding a rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irgun.png), believed that force is the only way to liberate the homeland. And was best known for The bombing of The King David Hotel (91 Killed).

Irgun was described as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, British and American governments.

Lehi's declared aim was to build a ""new totalitarian Hebrew republic"". They were extreme right-wing in their views and soaked in racism, their publications often described Jews as a “master race”. Lehi was Best know for the assassination of Lord Moyn, as well as the UN Swedish mediator Folke Bernadotte.

Lehi referred to its members as terrorists and admitted to have carried out terrorist attacks.

And Both of them carried out the [massacre of Dier Yassin]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir\_Yassin\_massacre) (107 Killed).


After the creation of Israel, the IDF was created, merging Haganah, Irgun, Lehi under one wing.


So What has some paramilitary groups to do with Netanyahu’s party?

Well, The former members of Irgun went on to form Herut, a Far-Right party (became Right-Wing afterward) that took part in Israel’s first election, The party was headed by Menachem Begin, an Ex-member of Haganah and former Commander of Irgun.


Worth mentioning That after the creation of Herut an [open letter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New\_Palestine\_Party;\_Visit\_of\_Menachen\_Begin\_and\_Aims\_of\_Political\_Movement\_Discussed) signed by a number of prominent Jewish Intellectuals, (Including Albert Einstein) condemned Herut as ""akin to Nazi and fascist parties"", and as a ""terrorist party"".

And its Leader was noted as ""leader of the notorious terrorist organisation"" by the British government and [banned](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5025439?v=1621559450796) from entering the United Kingdom.


After years of being active on the political floor, in 1973 Herut merged with other parties to form the Likud party, a name that you may already have heard of.

By 1977 they had grown in influence to win the election, And Menachem Begin came First.

Yes, the “leader of the notorious terrorist organization” Irgun, who had ruled the denounced ""terrorist, fascist"" party Herut, became Prime Minister of Israel.

Menachem was regarded as The Godfather Of [Israeli settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\_settlement) in the West-Bank and Gaza Strip.


Surprisingly in 1980 (during his rule time), the Israeli government gave amnesty to all Lehdi Members. And rewarded them with Lehdi Ribbon as recognition of their efforts to establish Israel. So literally they were forgiving and rewarding themselves for the crimes and terrorism they commit, meanwhile denouncing as “terrorist” every group trying to get back Palestine.


Due to health conditions, Menachem was forced to step aside and hand over the reins to a comrade-in-arms Yitzhak Shamir, Who was a former Irgun member, until he had moved to Lehi to become its leader.

So the leadership of Israel was switched from the hand of a former terrorist to another former terrorist.

Yitzhak ended up serving for 7 years to become the third longest-serving prime minister in the history of Israel.


Likud lost power to The labor party represented by Yitzhak Rabin (a former member of Haganah) but not for so long, a new challenger from the Likud party led a great effort to take the power again. By accusing Rabin’s government of being ""removed from Jewish tradition”, because of Olso’s peace accord that had been made between Palestinians and Israelis. The new challenger led a mock funeral procession featuring a coffin and hangman's noose at an anti-Rabin rally where protesters chanted, ""Death to Rabin"".

Rallies organized by Likud and other right-wing groups as objections to the Oslo accord.

And on the 4th of November 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing extremist Yagil Amir, Short after that, the chair was free for Benjamin Netanyahu.

Netanyahu lost power in 1999 and stepped aside from the political screen for a while, get back to the chair in 2009, and held it ever since to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel while leading a party that was born from terrorist roots.

This extremism and terrorism aspect in the Likud’s idealogy, and in the idealogy of its former leader (former terrorist with “Fascism” and xenophobia) explains why the government has been acting in this way. The IDF was made by a conjunction of these terrorist groups, that's why we see this inherited violence and brutality in them.

The first election was in 1949 from that time till now (75 years) almost half of it (35 years) was under the control of the Likud. It is really surprising how a party and its leaders with such “dirty” history could stay so long in a decision's position, In fact, how did they grab this position in the first place ?!

Israel’s policies, decisions, and the military has been seized by extremists and chauvinists whose groups and acts were condemned by many countries and by Israel itself.

It is frightening how they try to bound Zionism and Israel with the Jewish identity, to the point, it becomes almost impossible to criticize them or their acts and policies without being accused of antisemitism.",2023-10-13 11:50:20

Are there brave, principled, decent Palestinian individuals? _Of course._ *Obviously* any statement about any country does not mean 100% of the people are that way! But few if any of the generalizations we all make about Americans, Irish, French, Israelis etc. have as much basis in provable fact as the simple reality that Palestinians on the whole support violent antisemitic terrorism .

Palestinian culture & Palestinian society are all geared towards indoctrinating their children to hate Jews, and to see themselves as perpetual victims.
For every despicable Hamas operative, there are countless Palestinians—in Gaza, and around the world—who we see cheering for Hamas & expressing unambiguous support for what they did. Yes—*Expressing support & condoning the mutilation of babies, raping young women, slaughtering whole families.*

It is *mostly* our fault where we’re at today.

Our big egos though refused to accept that.

Even after losing every battle *we* started to get the land back, we didn’t accept the loss and tried again, and keep trying.

If we had in 1948 accepted the reality of a two state division, we would have saved alot of time, agony and bloodshed.

From the river to the sea.. Palestine will be free.

1043,"When looking at the massacre this week, it's important to remember that Israelis has seen that many times from Hamas before. Killing people in night clubs, blowing up civilian busses, shopping malls, and so on used to be Hamas default way of action in the 90s, before Israel closed the borders. Back in the 90s, Gaza used to export fruits, vegetables to Israel, people in Israel used to go eat in restaurants in Gaza/West Bank (same way Israelis go today to Israeli-Palestinian places, and work with Israeli-Palestinian). 

Unfortunately, Hamas started doing similar acts of terrorism (See Maxim Restaurant, https://youtu.be/KoHRwlHEHbQ, Dolphinarium Massacre https://youtu.be/wlQKMOvmaLc, and many others https://www.gov.il/en/Departments/General/suicide-and-other-bombing-attacks-since-the-declaration-of-principles), so Israel's response was to close the border, and later (2005) completely disconnect from Gaza and let Gazans rule Gaza. 

Unfortunately, instead of creating a prosperous city state, this caused a civil war in Gaza (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)) causing at least 118 Palestinians to be killed by other Palestinians. The Hamas won. And stayed in power to this day.

This caused both Israel and Egypt to stop cooperating with Gaza, which in turn made the economic situation in Gaza worse. With Hamas leaders getting net worths of billions of $ (Ismail Haniyeh's net worth is over $4 billion, and other Palestinian leaders are not far behind https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-the-phenomenal-wealth-of-hamas-leaders-1000957953, or search on Tiktok/X #GazaYouDontSee).

While the media tries to separate Hamas from Gazans, unfortunately Hamas couldn't operate if not for the support of civilians. And they get civilian support by starving and leaving them without work, by diverting donations, inventing employees and pocketing their salaries, by withdrawing supplies and creating deficiency, and blaming it on Israel, while buying luxury cars and building mansions in Gaza, Qatar and Egypt.

So while Saturday's massacre of civilians is devastating, it's actually nothing new from Gazan and Hamas. The only thing that changed, is that unfortunately, when Hamas was doing those atrocities in the past, there was no social media and camera phones to record it. And the news are easy to be bought. By the time social media appeared, Israel blocked Gaza, disengaged, made harsher security protocol and built Iron dome. So the number of casualties in Israel went down, while in Gaza went up.

With each successive violent eruption, I'm actually pushed a little farther to the left. I've always considered myself a Zionist because I identify with the classical definition written by Leon Pinsker in reaction to Jews being slaughtered in the Russian Empire. My definition of Zionism has never included death, oppression, and occupation. We can't give up. Palestinian liberation will ensure the future of Jewish liberation. We *cannot* allow the extremists and ideologues without a personal stake in the matter to pull us apart when I know the vast majority of us want peace, safety, and dignity for all.

That said, I am so appreciative that you acknowledge the difficulty within your own community. We're grieving so deeply for our dead right now.

I am also not sure how this current fighting will end. You seem to implicitly think that this will end with a bombing and go back to the old status quo. I do not think that will happen. When things like this have happened in the past, Israel has usually increased security measures, building protective walls and checkpoints and increasing occupation forces. They will do this for their own safety to prevent the same thing from happening again. This will almost certainly be a tragedy for the people of Gaza who will be impacted.

1064,"> the occupation

When you stop thinking of it as an ""occupation"", and start thinking of the Palestinians as a ""conquered people"" everything is a lot clearer.

Israel defeated them militarily. You had a fair war with Israel, who was surrounded and outnumbered and yet they won.

Just like the allies defeated the Nazis in WW2.

The Nazis were not left to roam free in Germany. They were occupied until these extreme elements were flushed out.

If you ask the Nazis if they were provoked, they could make all kinds of excuses, just like the Palestinians.

The Palestinians have never accepted defeat, and simply resort to terrorizing civilian populations. No one in the global community finds this acceptable - which is really the only thing that matters.

The Palestinians actively support an ideology as bad as the Nazis.

It is Israel's land because of military victory. They are nice to let the Palestinians stay. It's almost akin to letting Nazis stay. But if they continually agitate, they should leave.",2023-10-10 05:06:10

1070,"Babies. There are literally over a dozen beheadings of babies that Hammas filmed and uploaded to the internet from their attack. You can view them on Telegram, you don't need a national security clearance or special access to see Hammas went full ISIS level terror.

There are also dozens more videos of women and children being violated, tortured, drag to death behind vehicles, and beheaded.

\----------------------

The only solution to Hammas is the solution we had for ISIS. Kill all the fighters and men. Put the women and children into deprograming camps. Over 250k women and children of ISIS fighters filtered through such camps. Today only 25k remain. You can google it. There are books, news articles, documentaries and videos about it. It was the largest mass detainment of ""civilians"" since WWII. (with the participation of the west)

It was not done as retribution. It was the only way to save lives of people brainwashed into terrorist ideology. What do you do with kids who have participated in mass executions, forced or not, they are mentally scarred. What do you do with mothers who encourage children to grow up to be martyrs? It was the best solution to a horrible problem.

The videos of Hammas attack are available. You can watch them if you have the stomach for it.

And I know the history of the land from other nations as well , and I know what it looked like in 1800 and who was there and what happens 400 plus years before Islam was even created. So to say occupation ,or their land is just a joke. We have tried to co exist, they had every opportunity to do that . But every time they’ve choose to annihilate us. And it happens in 1948 with 6 countries against us and after a year plus of fighting we’ve gain control of what is bigger portion of the so called 2 state solution. And it continued to a war in 56’,67’ (six day war) 73’ yom kipor , 82 Lebanon war , first intifada  90’s and the list goes on. Any country that fought for their land  , and that went to war and lost . knew that losing meant , also losing their land in the process and just look at the history books in so called Europe and how many countries at some point all ruled over majority of Europe . From Italians , French , Germans , English and the list goes on and on. Israel was among the few who actually wanted peace and after conquering Sinai ,which is almost same size of Israel . offered it back in exchange for peace!!  and we’ve made the same efforts afterwards. Now mind you this we are not only the wining side, but also strategically more stronger .but we just don’t want to keep fighting and live like that. We didn’t have the USA support then. As a matter of fact Russia helped .And we are surrounded by 20 plus muslim countries . I always promoted live and let live and let’s stop fighting .and work on make our generation better and make things to improve lives. But when Palestinians still want to eradicate Jews for just being Jews .then there’s no freaking way. They choose Hamas in 2006 and they chose fatah before that. Both so called freedom fighters who wedge, jihad war on Jewish people. So how can anyone do peace with these people?!!! Every country in our generation would not only go to war against them , but will put an end to that threat! When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and killed 2k plus people , the USA retaliated in what known one of the biggest acts of war to ever recorded. that sent a message to the whole wide world not to mess with the USA or even try. When war is Syria took place within its own people and over 250k people are dying no one makes such a big deal out of it .and I’ve seen kids getting slaughtered while most of you stayed quite while the most purest things have been murdered. So there’s no 2 state solution especially with the likes of Hamas or any other Iranian extremist who call to kill Jews for being Jews .and it doesn’t stop from Jordan to the sea , they want it everywhere! So now it’s the time to strike back and make sure it will never happen again and these actions will echo for many generations not to mess with the Jewish people again. And remember all of you can walk proud and happy in Israel even if your Arab , LBGT or any other group .but the same cannot be said not only in Gaza but other Muslim countries around the world .where you have to think twice before drinking too much , or god forbid node the wrong way , or shaking hands with the left hand , or women who are treated like property and gay people aren’t even allowed, not to mention other religions. cause they have showed us what happened in the past. So if you read history pages ,read it not only in your language. check the Quran and understand who lived in the so called Palestine land 500 years before Islam was created. Who was there before the Greek and Roman Empire. Learn about Egyptian history and who were the Jews and where did they came from. And when you know this then maybe we can have a talk about fairness.

&#x200B;

* How do these people not see the irony in calling one of the world's smallest countries a colonizer. These people seem to be especially confused about what is being colonized. Is it all of Israel including its internationally declared and recognized 1948 borders? Is it the territories conquered in 1967 when Israel was facing a military mobilization from Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan all at the same time? Please again... you tell me what you would do if you were a very tiny country  surrounded on all sides by governments who were holding rallys declaring they would sweep the Jews into the sea. 
* ""But Israel is a European implant in the Middle East"" these people would declare. Right...tell that to the more than 60% of Israelis who are from Middle Eastern countries including Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, etc. My wife and her entire family ***walked*** from Iraq after being kicked out of Baghdad in the 40s. It is ***not*** the case that Middle Eastern countries were friendly and tolerant of Jews... and it **is** the case that Israel would not be a viable state without it having become a safe-haven for Middle Eastern Jews...  I'm sorry that this complicates the ""colonizer"" narrative but again, history matters. 

But the Occupation! Let me say at the outset of this last part... I oppose the occupation. The occupation of the West Bank is unequivocally wrong. It could have and should have been done with a long time ago - just like when the Sinai was returned to Egypt in exchange for peace. 

It really is too bad that Ehud Barak offered the entirety of the West Bank and Gaza to Yassir Arafat at Camp David in 2000, and all that Israelis got in return was the 2nd Intifada. More violence, more terrorism, more slamming the door on a long term solution. People seem to have some amnesia or historical ignorance around this as well. Do you really think that Israel has some sort of imperative to just control the West Bank for the sake of it? Now 23 years later, Ehud Barak's party (and really the entire peace camp - people who believe a solution can be worked out with the Palestinians - is really dead...) So now you get Netanyahu and he really does seem content to build more settlements and annex the West Bank.... 

It's a shame but it's hard not to see how things could have worked out differently... How about if Arab leaders accepted the 1947 partition plan? What if they made peace with Israel in 1967 instead of amassing their armies on the border? What if they had done with Egypt did in brokering peace in return for the West Bank and Gaza. What if the PA had accepted the 2000 Camp David accords? It would seem that it is still true that the Palestinians ""never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity."" 

What if - in 2023 -  Palestinians would recognize that Hamas can not and should not speak for them if there is ever to be peace. People who live democracy, peace and human rights don't go door-to-door murdering civilians and taking hostages.

Hamas, wants total warfare, because they believe once the Israeli ground invasion starts and the Palestinian death toll sky rockets they want the international community to step in and protect them from Israel. That they will ""win"" and ""defeat"" Israel by carrying out the most devestating attack on Israel since the '48 war and Israel won't be able to defend themselves and destroy Hamas.

“Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.”
John F. Kennedy.

Any honest conversation about Israel and Palestine must start with this uncomfortable truth, spelled out here in a leading Israeli newspaper, because it exposes the central lie at the heart of the matter which, until you comprehend it, you can never 
make sense of anything else.

""Israel does not want peace. There is nothing I have ever written that I would be happier to be proved wrong about. But the evidence is piling up. In fact, it can be said that Israel has never wanted peace – a just peace, that is, one based on a just compromise for both sides. It’s true that the routine greeting in Hebrew is Shalom (peace) – shalom when one leaves and shalom when one arrives. And, at the drop of a hat, almost every Israeli will say he wants peace, of course he does. But he’s not referring to the kind of peace that will bring about the justice without which there is no peace and there will be no peace. Israelis want peace, not justice, certainly not anything based on universal values. Thus, “Peace, peace, when there is no peace.” Not only is there no peace: In recent years, Israel has moved away from even the aspiration to make peace.""
http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-peace-conference/1.601112#!

""Even if Mahmoud Abbas fights with all he has to prevent terror against Israelis, and declares that he knows he will only ever return to Safed, his birthplace, as a tourist; and even if he declares that the Holocaust is the gravest crime in human history – even if he does all of that, Prime Minister Netanyahu will hasten to pour a bucket of cold water on his head. 

And even if the countries of the Arab League present Israel with an initiative that could kick-start some type of peace process, that contains an explicit invitation to a new kind of dialogue we’ve never seen before, for which we’ve yearned for years – the Israeli government will totally and demonstratively ignore it for 12 years and counting. 

It’s interesting: We only seriously tried the path of peace with the Palestinians once, in 1993. It failed, and from that moment on, it’s as if Israel decided to seal off that option once and for all. Here, too, see the twisted logic of despair at work: We’ve tried the path of war, occupation, terror and hatred dozens of times, never wearying of it or giving up on it, so why the rush to permanently divorce ourselves from peace, of all things, after a single failure?""
http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-peace-conference/1.601993#!

Israel wants land, not peace. Lasting peace would require Israel to return illegally annexed Palestinian land. Israel will never do that. It’s goal is to annex ALL of their land. No matter HOW angry Palestinians become. When they become violent, Israel crushes them - and uses it to justify its actions. Meanwhile, more and more settlements are being built on stolen land. While Israel has methodically derailed every peace initiative for years:

2014: ""In April, when negotiations broke down after nine months, US Secretary of State John Kerry explicitly blamed Israel for the breakdown in talks. His special envoy, Martin Indyk, a career Israel lobbyist, blamed Israel’s insatiable appetite for Palestinian land and continued expansion of the settlements, and handed in his resignation.""

“This is what Israel always does. Anybody who knows the history, it’s what the Israeli political scientist, the mainstream political scientist—name was Avner Yaniv—he said it’s these Palestinian “peace offensives.” Whenever the Palestinians seem like they are trying to reach a settlement of the conflict, which the unity government was, at that point Israel does everything it can to provoke a violent reaction—in this case, from Hamas—break up the unity government, and Israel has its pretext. “We can’t negotiate with the Palestinian Authority because they only represent some of the Palestinian people; they don’t represent all of the Palestinian people.” And so Netanyahu does what he always does—excuse me, what Israeli governments always do: You keep pounding the Palestinians, in this case pounding Hamas, pounding Hamas, trying to evoke a reaction, and when the reaction comes—well, when the reaction comes, he said, “We can’t deal with these people. They’re terrorists.”""
 http://www.democracynow.org/2014/7/15/after_palestinian_unity_deal_did_israel

At what point must we accept that there are no peaceful options left for the people of Gaza? That Netanyahu pulled out a re-election victory precisely by promising NO peace?

What if you’d become convinced that the official Israeli excuses to explain the occupation, built around the words “fear” and “security”, are all propaganda? That no genuine fear and security can explain settlements in the heart of a Palestinian population in the West Bank, in the heart of East Jerusalem or in Hebron? No fear and security can explain the expulsion of Palestinians from their home in favour of Jews, blacking out their cities, stealing their drinking water, surrounding them with concrete walls, directing sewage onto their crops, parents laughing as Israeli children surround Israel’s Arab children and beat them senseless with baseball bats? 

Or explain why Israel's blockade of Gaza stops people in Gaza having toilet paper, sanitary towels, light bulbs, candles, matches, books, musical instruments, crayons, clothing, shoes, mattresses, sheets, blankets, pasta, tea, coffee, chocolate, nuts, shampoo and conditioner, books and paper?

What if the day is approaching when our choices as outsiders -  after sanctions and diplomacy and international condemnation and UN pressure and economic isolation have all failed - will be to either support Israel’s continual oppression of the Palestinian people with no end in sight, or support Palestinian warriors as they wage a war of liberation against a powerful adversary? 

Can you and I, as people of good conscience, choose either?
We can and we must.

It was an Israeli ultra-nationalist terrorist who assassinated Israel's Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin for signing the Oslo Peace Accords. 

Israel has thousands of armed and militant hard-line extremists who strongly oppose peace. Israel also has extremists high inside its government who oppose peace, like Ayelet Shaked of the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, who recently called for the slaughter of Palestinian mothers who give birth to ""little snakes.""  The deputy speaker of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, said Israel must attack Gaza even more mercilessly, expel the population and resettle the territory with Jews. “Gaza is part of our Land and we will remain there forever,” Moshe Feiglin concludes. “Subsequent to the elimination of terror from Gaza, it will become part of sovereign Israel and will be populated by Jews."" Feiglin has a long history of extremism. He once called for Israel to cut off electric power to dialysis patients in Gaza. 

They were elected by Israeli hardliners whose views they represent, many of them American Jews, who oppose any peace that would include returning territory. They are well-armed and extremely dangerous and ready, willing and able to take up arms against their own government if such a peace was ever agreed to. 

Some are extremely cruel to Palestinians living near their settlements, as Brian Eno witnessed in 2013:  ""I was in Israel last year with Mary. Her sister works for UNWRA in Jerusalem. Showing us round were a Palestinian - Shadi, who is her sister's husband and a professional guide - and Oren Jacobovitch, an Israeli Jew, an ex-major from the IDF who left the service under a cloud for refusing to beat up Palestinians. Between the two of them we got to see some harrowing things - Palestinian houses hemmed in by wire mesh and boards to prevent settlers throwing shit and piss and used sanitary towels at the inhabitants; Palestinian kids on their way to school being beaten by Israeli kids with baseball bats to parental applause and laughter; a whole village evicted and living in caves while three settler families moved onto their land; an Israeli settlement on top of a hill diverting its sewage directly down onto Palestinian farmland below; The Wall; the checkpoints… and all the endless daily humiliations. I kept thinking, ""Do Americans really condone this? Do they really think this is OK? Or do they just not know about it?""

sick of bearded guys walking around with their guns abusing their power, beating up or incarcerating young people demonstrating for what they believe in; 

sick of the wall of shame that separates us from the rest of our country and keeps us imprisoned in a stamp-sized piece of land; 

sick of being portrayed as terrorists, home-made fanatics with explosives in our pockets and evil in our eyes; 

sick of the indifference we meet from the international community, the so-called experts in expressing concerns and drafting resolutions but cowards in enforcing anything they agree on; 

we are sick and tired of living a shitty life, being kept in jail by Israel, beaten up by Hamas and completely ignored by the rest of the world.”

Because Palestinian refugees tried to overthrow the government of Jordan when they were welcomed there in the early 1970s. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September)

Forced to flee, they moved into Lebanon and started a civil war there in the mid-1970s.(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War)

When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, many Palestinians there celebrated, which got them expelled once Kuwait was liberated. (https://www.meforum.org/3391/kuwait-expels-palestinians)

None of this is the fault of the current generation. But they've been so radicalized by Hamas-run schools, starting as early as kindergarten, that no country wants them (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rbyrPUP218Q) That indoctrination is what enables them to publish videos of themselves slitting throats and assaulting women and somehow expect to be praised for it.

EDIT: Rephrasing my conclusion as ""No government wants to accept any significant number of refugees from Gaza.""

No one wants them in their country."") was too broad with ""No one"" and an ambiguous ""them"".",2023-10-12 02:49:38

Their resoluteness on this has been staggering, so that we now have fourth-generation Palestinian refugees—a truly unprecedented thing in the history of refugees. 

This brutal policy of not absorbing refugees has been successful in so far as it has caused the retention of a Palestinian people waiting for a state—however many Arab leaders normalize relations with Israel, the existence of this nation without a state on their own (if shared) territory still demands resolution.

 It is noteworthy that, according to the crossings agreement concluded in 2005 between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian Authority assumed security control over the Rafah crossing, but with European observers supervising traffic through it.  Also, do not forget that the Palestinians do not want mass immigration, especially at the present time, for several reasons, including that they do not want to leave their homeland to be stolen. Opening the borders does not solve the basic problem, and it is difficult to return Palestine. I want to add that Israel bombed the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border 3 times in the last two days, and it is damaged.

1381,"I'm neither an Arab nor Israeli, I'm Portuguese. From what I know (or think I do) the case for Egypt is a bit different nowadays, If we're talking geopolitically Egypt  has a solid working wage population (check the average age if I recall it's like 25 years old), and they should be able to contest their spot in the east Mediterranean as the rising economic hegemon in the next 20 to 30 years. For that, sympathy and more importantly good economic relationships with the west are a most! Especially because they will have to contend with the current east Mediterranean power (the Turks). And I guess those decades of diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt also have to be worth something.

As for the other Arab nations, (and I'm going a bit of personal opinion here) it isn't that simple. Some don't have a solid constitutional foundation, and a large wave of migrants could upset the current political climate in that country. Furthermore the means and organization to maintain those refuses just aren't there.
More importantly still, the idea that the Arab world is united in anyway is at best laughable, pety disputes like religious differences, political systems, and just a general xenophobia keep them divided. It's not that they particularly love Palestinians, although they might feel a religious and/or some other type of connection to them, is that they hate the state of Israel just like you said and they are focused in their own national interests, having 500k or more refugees just isn't one of them.

My Middle-Eastern modern history is a bit fuzzy but I remember in the 50’s and 60s, while all the neighbouring Arab countries were all about shoving Israel into the sea, none of them reached out to the Palestinians in any useful way. Get rid of the Jews and the Pals can settle down again. Fast forward assorted diplomatic and Israeli-centric political maneuverings and the Pals have less and less and the Israelis more. But, as Israel is the one democratic country in such a hot part of the world, the West (mostly the USA) was happy to supply whatever it could to them in arms, knowledge, etc. Call it guilt or a sound investment or both. But still, the surrounding Arab countries never raised a fuss about their Pal kinsmen. They never have. 

The PLO said and did many dreadful things and the Israelis returned it many-fold. The other Arab states did not say or do much then either. There were efforts made but nothing really changed the trajectory. Diplomates came and went, assassinations were thwarted or succeeded. Breathless articles were written as were books that “explained” everything...but they didn’t. 

I may be way off now but I remember reading somewhere (a long time ago) that the Pals were considered backward, ignorant, 2nd class citizens by the other Arab countries who all have a long glorious history of royalty and antisemitism. Remember Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran? He of the ugly beige jacket. He’s still busy in Iran’s gov. I don’t remember him being sympathetic to the Pals when he was prez of Iran. But he’d fund them. Rather like Putin’s army of meat. Just keep throwing them out there. 

Hamas and pretty much all of the Islamic organizations (religious) are dead set against a two-state solution, as is Israel, currently being run into the ground by Netanyahu who treats Israel like his own personal fiefdom and bank. What has happened this week is atrocious but it’s really not anything new. Hamas came up with a plan and executed it in a way that made it obvious that Netanyahu and his Lukid/coalition were not paying attention.

Even just a small portion of it should satisfy everyone.

With this policy, the ruling party in Turkey is trying to show that it takes responsibility to the countries of the world and is also trying to get funds from Europe.  While doing these, it does not care about the welfare of the indigenous people in his country, endangers the security of the borders and allows the demographic structure of his country to change to Arabic culture.  At the same time, it aims to strengthen it's ruling by collecting the votes of these refugees in the elections.  It's a devastating situation for the local people in Turkey.
I feel worried about the future of the Turkish people. Their modern and civilized country is turning into a radical Islamic country.
Let me not forget to mention this too.  European countries are very pleased with Turkey's attitude.  By sacrificing an amount of money that would not be a problem for them, they prevent millions of refugees from migrating to their country.  European countries talk about the sanctity of accepting refugees at all kinds of world meetings, but they themselves do not want to accept any refugees.  Some even say without hesitation, ""We should increase the aid provided to Turkey regarding refugee acceptance, so that they do not send refugees who have the potential to come to our countries.""

1. The Arab world is not a monolith and should not be treated as such. It is large and diverse with different cultures, traditions, cuisines, and dialects within. Spain and Portugal speak dialects of the same language, practice the same religion, and have a long history of cultural overlap and exchange.

1469,"From https://reddit.com/r/vancouver/s/UMZIzyMf41

Palestine has been genocidal towards the Jews for literally forever.  The state was founded on the idea of Jewish erasure and named Palestina as a reference to the Phillistines who invaded and enslaved the second Jewish commonwealth on the land.   This was done to remind the Jews of their place as slaves and lessen their attachment to their homeland.  There would literally be no Palestine without the theme of Jewish erasure or the fact that it was the Jewish homeland for many generations before Palestinians even existed.

Back in 1977 before the current narrative of infantilized Palestine was a thing the leader of the major ruling political party of Palestine the PLO, of which Fatah is a part, had this to say about what Palestine was.

“The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan. -Zuheir Mohsen, PLO leader

From: “Wij zijn alleen Palestijn om politieke reden,” James Dorsey, Trouw, 31 March 1977.

More honest times I suppose.  An era when social media could not be used to the advantages it is today.

This is why ironically Palestinians were only granted autonomy over their land once Israel was formed.  The Ottoman, British, Jordanian and Egyptians never allowed a formal Palestine state.

before Hamas existed modern Palestine has been calling for genocide and long before Israel existed they have been murdering Jews.

Riots in Jerusalem against Jews based on myths and antisemitism, like claims Jews drink the blood of children for Passover, have a long pedigree going back to 1847, 1870, and more. A massacre much like the one Hamas committed was done in 1929 in Hebron, resulting in the expulsion and wiping out of the entire Jewish community there, which had been there for thousands of years consistently.

“The riots took the form, for the most part, of attacks by Arabs on Jews accompanied by destruction of Jewish property. During the week of riots, from 23 to 29 August, 133 Jews were killed by Arabs, and 339 Jews were injured, most of whom were unarmed”

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots

This isn’t about Israel and the land it’s about religion and an obsession with Jewish extermination.

In the sayings of Muhammad in the Hadiths, Muhammad prophesy that End Times will only come when the Muslims have almost genocide the Jews into extinction:

""The last hour won't come before the Muslims would fight the Jews and the Muslims will kill them so Jews would hide behind rocks and trees. Then the rocks and tree would call: oh Muslim, oh servant of God! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. - Hadith narrated by Abi Hurira

The leader of Palestine didn’t hang out in the concentration camps and work with Hitler on his Final Solution because Israel existed.

Not Zionists, not Israel, not Orthodox Jews, not practicing Jews, all Jews, every one of them removed from the face of the earth. Palestine still calls for this to this day.

A quote from 2019. “Seven million Palestinians outside, enough warming up, you have Jews with you in every place. You should attack every Jew possible in all the world and kill them.”

And people will say that Hamas is not Palestine, and it’s true not everyone in Palestine supports Hamas, but the majority do.  Not just in Gaza but all of Palestine.

Despite people claiming that they are merely oppressed by a government they don't support, polls show that the most popular Palestinian presidential candidates are, in order:

• ⁠A man in Israeli prison for murdering multiple civilians in bombings during the Second Intifada, including arranging others who suicide bombed markets and buses. • ⁠Hamas leader. • ⁠Hamas leader.

And the Palestinian public, as polls have shown for at least a decade (and as shown by history stretching back to before Israel existed), is also broadly supportive of murdering Jewish civilians.

Today, polls show that a full 54% support, and only 41% oppose, ""armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel"". That means the average Palestinian supports precisely what Hamas did, massacring Jewish innocents, including men, women, children, and the elderly. Palestinians celebrated the attacks in the streets, and handed out sweets (just as they did after 9/11, for that matter). In Gaza specifically, which poses the thorniest problem, 67% of Palestinians support the armed attacks against Israeli civilians inside Israel.

67%. 2 in 3 Gazans you meet will tell you openly they support the murder of innocent people.

Link to the most recent poll I could find from September 2023 where these stats come from.

https://pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/Poll%2089%20English%20Full%20Text%20September%202023.pdf

This is why there is never peace.  Because Palestine will never accept it.  Every peace has been broken by Palestinian attacks and every attempt for two state resolution has been rejected or interrupted by rocket fire, assassination of Jewish politicians or terror attacks.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_peace_process

1470,"You found the answer. Hamas charter is like ISIS, with a clear ideology, which is to annihilate the Jewish state and kill all Jews. That’s what all the terrorist organizations call for and Iran has said they’re in full support of what’s happening right now",2023-10-11 23:14:19
1471,"They are in such vehement denial that Hamas and Arab anti-Semitic extremist organizations are the aggressors it blows my mind.

Palestinians claim they’ve always owned the land when in reality the Ottomans and then the British directly administered it, Jews and Palestinians had about the same amount of small patches of privately owned land scattered throughout the Ottoman/British-owned territory, then when Britain decided to pull out of Palestine in the late 40s they drew up a partition plan that took into consideration the Jewish and Palestinian populations who BOTH lived there for millennia.

The Arab world rejected the partitions then started 4 wars in which they got humiliated each time, and rightfully lost land they otherwise would’ve kept if they just played nice and recognized from the beginning that Jews have just as much of a valid claim to the land as Palestinians do.

I detest that Israel has stooped so low as to retaliate in kind to Hamas atrocities and aggressions, but what else are they supposed to do when Hamas is using innocent Palestinian civilians as human shields? The IDF at least has had the decency to warn Gazans of imminent attacks on these Hamas strongholds. The real question is why does Hamas base these strongholds in hospitals and schools?

Israel is facing extremist groups who believe there is a divine imperative to bring out the total destruction of Israel no matter the means. Read the Hamas charter for instance. Israel is locked in a fight for its very existence against groups who don’t play by any rules whatsoever and have shown with the October attack that they could care less about wasting innocent lives. They are facing groups that push upon the youth a distorted and bastardized version of history and a plethora of misinformation to try and radicalize them. Israel has been on the defensive since it’s conception.

Palestinian children in Gaza are being held hostage by their own government and Israel has every right to wipe Hamas out for good so that they can bring about a chance for Palestinians to self govern and have true stability and peace.",2023-10-12 04:27:39
1472,"I am an American Jew ,who served in Israel IDF. and I will try to my best of my knowledge to explain to you ,how there’s no occupied land and how Israel has been extremely restrained in her actions for many years. 
I urge you to show this to the rest of the people who claim to be pro Palestine￼

1. When Germany lost portion of their land after WW1 , which the same happened to : Italy , Greece , Ottoman Empire , the British and more. 
None of them called out and said we want our land back that’s ours and called occupation! But Palestinian do!

Now let me remind you who lived In the area 400 and 500 years before Islam was even born! Cannan and Judea. Never palestine! In 135 CE, after stamping out the province of Judea’s second insurrection, the Romans renamed the province Syria Palaestina—that is, “Palestinian Syria.” They did so resentfully, as a punishment, to obliterate the link between the Jews and our land! 

But let’s fast forward and reach 1948 when the two state solution took place . Us Jews after the WW2 and the HOLOCAUST ,were more than happy with that because we get to live in a place we called home after being slaughtered for being Jewish. The arabs were not. They went to war against us with not 1 country behind them but 5 ! They’ve lost and we conquered that land! Now why is that okay for all the other countries throughout history to gain that control and why we don’t hear occupied territories?!  That wasn’t the only time that this took place . The same happen at 56,67,73,82 and into the 90’s and 2000’s . So after all these attempted not only we didn’t want that land we gave them some more so they can stop and try to attack us in between coffee breaks and night times.

2. Now that you understand that Israel not only won over 6 wars and  far more stronger. We have yet to destroy or harm them viciously like they have done on this past Saturday of October 7th. 
I have personally had kids shooting at me and the easiest thing to do is to eliminate that threat.  but instead we ducked down and waited for a 10 year old to finish his magazine. Same goes to kids coming to IDF posts in Israel border with explosive belt on them ( who the F does that and send kids to fight their wars and manipulate innocent lives) 

We have never killed kids or women the way they did this past Saturday! When we bomb a place that launched rockets into Israel we give them warning and tell them to vacate , but Hamas tells them not to leave and use them as human shield and keep firing rockets . so it’s either us or those  monsters that hide behind old people and kids. Mind you these people can escape which some do . But afterwards Hamas catch them and butcher them and their family Members. Just search that in Gaza and you’ll see. 

So now for the first time in many decades, Israel won’t hold back and it will release its full power. and whichever country who will come against us will get the same faith . So Iran , Yemen , Iraq bring it ! and we will be over a million strong and since we have no other country we will be more than willing to die defending ours. As for the Hamas and their other terrorist friends we will make sure you get to meet your 72 virgins. 

So before you pass judgment on Israel, imagine what would you do if your family and loved ones were targeted just for their religion and being and your sisters , daughters and mothers gotten raped in front of your eyes and you’ve being forced to watch cause you’re handcuffed and an AK47 to your head?! 
When less than that happened on Pearl Harbor and the Japanese attacked American soldiers and civilians and killed over 2,000 people. The USA launched an attack that shock the whole world and killed more than 200k people. 
80 years past by and no one question them nor have the balls to attack the USA as a country face on.

1477,"The presence of Israel is just a small factor that the Arab Muslims can all agree they hate together. But in truth their #1 problem is Islam never underwent a reformation that could co-exist with Enlightenment and secular values. Whereas western societies are in a constant state of value introspection from decade to decade. And then this translates politically to non-Muslims not wanting to immigrate, invest, or start businesses in those societies, which just furthers the economic and idealogical divides between them and the west. 

The Muslims spent 800 years occupying and expanding into Europe and times were good for them. They were razing temples and synagogues and converting them into mosques. They built the Dome of the Rock over the Jewish Temple Mount to gloat over the victory and prevent the Jews from ever rebuilding the temple. Now that their religious values are incompatible with the modern world and the Jews are inflicting on them what they had been doing for nearly 1000 years, all they can do is rage at the west and make hypocritical demands of deference to their religion that they refuse to make for other religions. 

I pity them for not having exposure to an education that doesn’t brainwash and radicalize them, dooming them to repeat the cycle for the next generation. Salvaging Palestine would be about as viable as salvaging North Korea. They aren’t like Japan, willing to emulate the US while under occupation to achieve the same degree of success.

Everyone was so kind. Educated, rational, and well versed in worldly things. We felt so safe and welcome.

As I moved to other Arab nations, people swore as and spit at our feet when they heard we were just vacationing in Israel as well. My sister was harassed. We learned very quickly how intolerant Arab nations were. We constantly felt unsafe. I had to hold my sisters hand everywhere we went and guard her from aggressive men that would literally try and grope her off the streets.

When we were in Israel everyone was so positive and supportive. When we told them we were going to Egypt and Jordan next they gave us good information on things to do, places to see. They wished us well.

They gave us their contact info and said not to hesitate if we needed anything etc

They do not like this and fire rockets at group B with some but not much result.  So group B is faced with an impossible choice: continue to dominate group A, keep them locked up and destitute, or let them become stronger and attack effectively.  Group A can either suffer and starve, or try to fight those who are effectively imprisoning them.

Palestinians never wanted the jews to exist there. Ever since the early days where they legally co-habitated, Muslims just couldn't stand to live in a not fully Muslim state.

It has always been a sob story about ""they took our land"" not ""we want to live in a sharia state.   The British took the land. The Palestinians refused to participate in the democratic system that was put in place. The wealth and education disparity between European jews probably didn't help. 

When the Israelis finally gave Palestinians the pure Islamic states they begged for, they refused an offer to become their own independent nations. Instead, opting for being a walled territory with the hopes of conquering  the Israel some day.

The one-state solution left some gray zones, where Isaeli development in certain areas are TECHNICALLY legal, but make use of loopholes in laws. These are the settlements everyone whines about.


Most impactfully, the Palestinians use propaganda of being an oppressed underdog in an apartheid state (not reminding everyone it was the system THEY demanded.) In reality, they are constantly throwing themselves at Israel in such a way that they maximize the collateral of Israel's self defense actions. They sent kids in suicide vests so young boys are considered threats when they are sent to charge checkpoints. They fire rockets from the densest parts of their cities to instigate counter strikes, which invariably kill civillians. They charge and aggravate troops in threatening ways with the sole intention of getting killed to create an uproar.

""Im seeing many posts saying the Palestinians are being occupied by the Israelis and I don’t understand what the problem is considering the land concessions the governing bodies decline to accept.""

I am hoping that what you mean here is that you dont understand why the Palestinian government won't accept the deals rather than you dont understand why people would still have an issue with decades of oppression of the Palestinian people. 


""All I see is Jewish hatred from the Palestinian people who elected Hamas knowing full well their intentions with Israel."" 

The average Palestinian age is 20 and half of them are children. The majority of people were not old enough to remember or even alive when Hamas was voted into power. They have known no life outside of occupation.

You are not looking very far if that is all you feel like you are seeing. I am seeing mountains of handwringing about whether or not the Israeli government has a right to wipe Palestinians off the map.


""I don’t see these putrid crimes of hatred committed by Hamas as justified. Comments like “the bully is getting bullied” and “they had it coming” are outright in support of Jewish death.""

I agree. I think the conversation about the place of armed resistance when combatting systematic oppression is a  valid one to have, but I dont think rape and torture fall under 'by any means necessary.' 

That does not in anyway take away from my support for the liberation of the Palestinian people.


""Announced attacks by Israel where civilians have enough time to leave cannot be compared to a surprise attack where hundreds of innocents were slaughtered, mutiliated, and paraded around Gaza like trophys."" 

Why do you so easily accept that Palestinians should just be fine giving up their homes to be bombed and where exactly do you think they can go to escape this violence, which is happening everywhere around them? Gaza is like 25 miles wide and they arent letting people in or out.

If you feel that way about the Hamas attack on Oct 7th, how do you feel about the death toll of Palestinian civilians over the past ten years that completely dwarves that of Israel? There is a complete asymmetry of violence enacted on the Palestinian people if you step outside of Oct 7th. Israel is poised to wipe the Palestinians off the map in the coming weeks. There is not now and has never been any comparable threat from Hamas to Isreali people. We cant equate oppression with resistance to oppression.


""You have Hamas bases underneath hospitals and city centers where they use the innocent Palestinian people as cannon fodder so they can plea to the rest of the world that the Israelis killed innocent Palestinians.""

I see the exact same thing from the Israeli government - using the Oct 7th attack to justify horrific violence on the Palestinian people. Both the Israeli government and Hamas are using civilians as pawns. 


""Can someone clarify to me what exactly the problem Palestine has with Israel because all I can tell is the problem is Israel just existing.""

1543,"What I'm gonna say it's copied from the Palestinian subreddit

"" To understand how a person turns into a terrorist who is ready to throw himself at a tank in torn shorts, it is enough to assess the living conditions of people in the Gaza Strip. The Strip is surrounded by a 65-kilometer wall of concrete, steel, barbed wire, surveillance cameras and motion sensors. The wall height is from 7 to 9 meters, depending on the site. Every two kilometers – a machine-gun turret, which is controlled remotely. The wall patrols on land, water, and air and continues underground. There are only four passageways in the wall. Each has a checkpoint system with Gates, bars, barbed wire and machine gunners. Inside, on 365 square kilometers, 2.3 million people live.

Gaza has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt for 16 years.

The list of permitted / prohibited goods is constantly changing, and at various stages included imports of food, paper, pencils, soccer balls, musical instruments, books, candles, clothing, tableware, refrigerators, washing machines, glasses, light bulbs, matches, needles , blankets, shoes, mattresses, automobile parts and building materials (glass, concrete, iron, wood, paint, doors, pipes, generators, wires), fuel, fishing gear, hearing aids, wheelchairs. Without access to materials, it is impossible to restore Gaza's infrastructure. In particular, the water pump that provides the inhabitants of Gaza with water is clogged.

As a result of the blockade, hospitals in Gaza lack equipment and basic medicines, so patients have to seek help in Israel or the West Bank. To see a doctor, residents of Gaza have to ask Israel for permission to go outside the perimeter. Unauthorized access to the barrier – execution. Going to sea - execution. The airport was destroyed.

Most Gaza residents live below the poverty line and depend on the ability to leave the perimeter and work in Israel. To do this, they also need permission. The average salary in Gaza is $ 384/month. but over the past 6 years, it has fallen by 20%. The unemployment rate is 46.6%. Electricity is available from 4 to 13 hours a day, and depends entirely on the will of Israel. Now it doesn't exist at all. The only source of light is explosions. 35% of Gaza's agricultural land and 85% of its fishing areas are inaccessible to its inhabitants, as it is being shot through by Israel, which continues its expansion into Palestinian Territories. There are fewer and fewer of them. Regardless of their attitude towards Hamas, All Gaza residents depend on the organization for their daily needs. The majority of Gaza residents suffer from certain mental disorders: 93% have an anxiety disorder, 44% have severe chronic depression.

No, it's not a prison. This is a concentration camp. And then, suddenly, a rave takes place on its border, and everyone is now ""shocked"", they say, Where did these ""animals"" come from and attacked ""civilization"" - the disco of the ""beautiful and prosperous"" on the border with disaster. This catastrophe shocks the liberal inhabitants of the world for some reason less than the tearful faces of stoned majors who are carried away in the trunk by reality.

One issue is propaganda bots. A lot of hateful posts come from fake people. 

But, to the extent that this is a real problem, I believe the fundamental problem is that, because of a combination of personality disorders in some pro-Israel people and PTSD in Israelis, many visible pro-Israel people come off as legalistic, self-involved and rude. 

They write based on the perspective that all non-Jewish people and liberal Jewish people with even slightly critical views about Israel are unworthy of attention. 

One symptom: The people who come here, start posts with something like “Why do all Palestinians…?”, then give me 500 words about the Balfour declaration and what the PLO did in 1972. 

OK. I had tests on that in Hebrew school. I get where that’s coming from. It has nothing at all to do with how regular non-super-hawkish Israelis see Israel today. 

So, OK, most of those people aren’t calling for violence toward anyone. They don’t violate Reddiquette. But they aren’t thinking about how they’re coming off to non-Zionists. 

Then you have the stories about Jewish Israelis harassing the Bedouin or marching around Jerusalem and insulting anyone who looks Arab, and trashing Reform Jews.

So, then the horrific news of the Hamas attack shows up, and Israel’s international relations outreach has been so poor that I start to oay attention to the speculation that Netanyahu and Ben Gvir let this happen to justify flattening Gaza.

1553,"Reducing the issue to anti-semitism reduces the conflict to a simplistic narrative that isn’t derived from fact or the history.

The basic reason you are seeing Israeli hate is because Zionism has always been an expansionary settler movement, that created anxiety in the local Palestinian population since the late 1800’s. It’s not hard to see a correlation between what you percieve as anti-semitism in the region with the violent creation of the Israeli state. This is something that was actually predicted by early zionist leaders:

Ben-Gurion said in 1918: ""We as a nation want this country to be ours; the Arabs, as a nation, want this country to be theirs"". Resistance was to be expected. Jabotinsky said in 1921: ""I don't know of a single example in history where a country was colonised with the courteous consent of the population"" And ""Every indigenous people will resist alien settlers as long as they see any hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement. This is how the Arabs will behave and go on behaving so long as they possess a gleam of hope that they can prevent Palestine from becoming the Land of Israel.""

The entire reason Israel is considered an Apartheid state is derived from the Zionist aims to subjugate the Palestinians and remain the absolute demographic majority in order to maintain the idea of Israel being a Jewish homeland. This is repeatedly cited in reports from B’Tselim, Amnesty, Human Rights Watch & Numerous UN special Raperteurs, among other parties, who have published similar legal findings of Apartheid in Israel. 

So what is the problem with Israel existing? It‘s the fact that the Palestinians have no political recourse to protect their right to self-determination in their land, which has been historically eaten up, divided and provoked mass exodus of Palestinians from their home. At the same time, a Jew living in long Island has the ability to call Israel his home, where many Palestinians who have lived in Palestinian for generations are rejected from returning to their homes. Further fuel is thrown into the fire by the constant control of Palestinian lives and the illegal disposetion of their homes so that a foreign Jew from another part of the world can claim at as their rightful home. 

All the above, and more, is the problem with “Israel just existing”. Does anti-semitism exist in Palestine? For sure there is some. Is it the reason for all the issues you’ve been seeing lately? Definitely not. Does anti-Palesitinism exist in Palestine? Its hard to argue otherwise, given how institutional, ideological, systemic and long-lasting the occupation has been. 

I have friends from both ends of the aisle, and what is clear to me is that in the end of the day, it is a land dispute between an occupied people and colonizers, both of whom are indigenous to the land. All these side discussions from both sides relating to hate (ethnic, religous and otherwise) and security only stem from the root cause of occupation. Both parties deserve to live in peace and dignity, but concessions need to be made by both sides. 

Palestine need to elect moderate leaders who are not self-serving, and recognize Israel is here to stay. Israel need to recognize Palestinian rights, dismantle their occupation/Apartheid and re-align their goals from short/medium term success of establishing complete control of Palestine and instead focus on long-term goals of establishing organic peace as opposed to following extremist ideological goals.",2023-10-12 06:31:42

**B:** The side with less hard power is always righteous. Palestine has taken more casualties over the past decades, and they have less tech, so they must be the good guys. Things like combat vs civilians deaths, or Gaza using human shields, or preventative deaths, are completely irrelevent in their eyes (assuming they can understand these concepts to begin with).

**C:** Colonialism is bad. The fact that palestinians are no more ""native"" to the area than israeli's are is something they can't comprehend because in their mind the middle east belongs to arab people. I'm not exaggerating when I say most of these people who rant about colonialism think history played out like this:>Humans of different races were placed in their respective continents and everyone lived peacefully within respected borders.>People within their ethnicity always got along and never fought each other.>White people invented gunpowder and went around colonizing and messing everything up because they're mean.

You think Hamas attacked Israel because Jews live there? Trust me, it wouldn’t matter if they were English or Dutch Protestants. Wouldn’t matter if they were Godless Chinese atheists. Wouldn’t matter if they were green aliens. Israel has perpetrated a decades-long, brutal military occupation of Palestinian territories, inside the ‘67 borders, in violation of international law, condemned by the World Court, slicing up the West Bank into disconnected communities with illegal settlements and turning Gaza into a Concentration Camp. 

All of it bought and paid for with US tax dollars, and there is absolutely *nothing* the international community can do diplomatically to stand up against the world’s sole superpower. Look at the record of US vetoes in the Security Council as they relate to Israel/Palestine. There will be no diplomatic solution as long as the US keeps blocking it and sending Israel *huge* amounts of military aid, far more than it does to any other country. The balance of power is overwhelmingly in Israel’s favor, hence, if you look at the casualties, they are overwhelmingly Palestinian. 

This has nothing to do with antisemitism, which is much more prevalent and pernicious in Europe and the United States, and everything to do with an illegal, brutal occupation intended to bring about the slow erasure of the Palestinian people and state. Which will now accelerate exponentially. 

If you really want to go down the religious rabbit-hole, try this: as European Jews were becoming the slow victims of their own hideous destruction and erasure of their communities and culture during the Holocaust (worst moral crime in history? Absolutely!) would you have accorded them the rights to stand up against their imprisonment and murder by their oppressors with violence, if necessary, even though it wasn’t even an option for most Jews, save for those very few who tried to resist? **OF COURSE YOU WOULD!!**

If the horrors of Treblinka, Dachau, Majdanek, Sobibor, Auschwitz, etc,  could have been subverted by armed resistance leading to German & Polish casualties, would you have supported it? **OF COURSE!!** 

But nobody, absolutely nobody, cared about the fate of the people in those prisons at the time, *certainly* not the United States. And that’s the lesson. They said never forget, right? **So don’t!** Don’t forget about people who are being stepped on and extinguished with your tax money. 

Hamas’ tactics will not succeed. But you need to recognize that there are no other tactics when this occupation is supported consistently by the most powerful nation in history and its media, who are currently doing everything they can to make sure Americans have *only one* narrative to follow here. 

You won’t hear about how these people are imprisoned by land, air, & sea, and have been for decades, cut off from the West Bank as it becomes subsumed into Israel, watching the slow erasure of what remains of Palestine. You won’t hear about what life is like in the occupied territories. 

The only people capable of stopping this brutality are Americans. By putting pressure on their government to stop supporting a violent, illegal occupation and slow ethnic cleansing of Israel.",2023-10-12 07:09:23
1595,"Try to understand the scenario completely, it is the only way it makes sense.

Palestine had been living there for generations, practicing religion on this sacred ground, and then out of nowhere the city council comes in and says we're taking half your land and giving it to a group of people that practice a different religion than you. They also will end up having dramatically more money than you, completely control your water and power, show you nothing but disrespect and abuse for decades.

Referring to the Israeli occupation of Palestine as a “conflict” or the Israeli attacks as part of a “war” incorrectly serves to create a false equivalence between the two parties, as if they were equal and balanced.

Israel is an independent nation that invests USD 20 billion per year in military and intelligence forces, which are among the most sophisticated in the world. It controls the borders, skies, sea coasts, telecommunications and economy of Palestine, whose government has extremely limited autonomy. Palestinian armed resistance for years has included knives, fireworks, homemade explosives and paragliders as an essential part of its arsenal. The Palestinians have no tanks, planes, warships, submarines or heavy artillery. In recent years, they have received more foreign military aid — still paltry compared to the might of the Israeli military.

Israel is not at “war” or “conflict” with Hamas or the nation of Palestine — it is an illegal colonial occupation force that uses its powerful army to, on a daily basis, commit crimes against humanity to repress the Palestinians, a people who is resisting their racist colonization.",2023-10-12 05:24:56

1609,"It not that complicated.  In 1897 the idea of Zionism started about re-establishing a Jewish State in the Middle East.   The Ottoman Empire had ruled the area of hundreds of years.  It was the largest Muslim empire in the world.   The Ottoman Empire took the side of Germany in WWI.   

While WWI was ongoing the British government floated the idea of a Jewish State thru a document called the Balfour Document in 1917.   During WWI the British government wanted to enlist Jewish support in the War.  Jewish populations largely supported Germany prior to the declaration.    World War I ends and the Ottman's and Germany has lost.   What to do?

Following the Armistice of Mudros, most Ottoman territories were divided between Britain, France, Greece and Russia. The Ottoman Empire officially ended in **1922** when the title of Ottoman Sultan was eliminated.   Turkey became a country in 1923. 

The are of Palestine falls under control of the British Government through Mandate for Palestine passed by the league of nations.   It called for the establishment of a two nation state.   The one key issue is there is already somebody living in the territory the Palestinian popolation.

During the 1930's the British allowed and did a whole lot of bad things to the native population of the time to allow for the rise of Jewish control.    WWII happens and the holocaust.   Many jews fled Europe and went to the middle east before and during the war.    

The UN is formed post WWII.    A resolution is passed 181 that calls for the establishment of a Jewish state and a Palestinian state.   The problem is this resolution was rather one sided gave more land and better land to the Jewish state when the population of the area was largely non-jewish.    Worse, the agreement did not receive support from the local countries (the Arab League) and the local population was against it.    The Mandate expires and the British pull out.

A civil war occurs.   The Jewish population is armed by Britain, the United State and even Stalin through Czechoslovakia.   The Jewish declare a state in 1948 and immediately go to war with its neighbors and they win.   The result is 700,000 non-Jewish citizens are thrown off their land to allow for the formation of the Jewish State.   The United States is responsible for getting the UN vote passed.   It was done becuase of domestic concerns with Jewish voters, outstanding Jewish lobbying and threats of the US on smaller nations and even bribes.   The Key is none of the arab states supported it.   

So basically we have hundreds of thousands of folks thrown off their land.   Kept in refugee camps since the 1950's.   Both Israel and the Arab world largely ignored the refugee issue and folks have lived in poverty and despair since.   This breads hatred.   Israel took the land, held the land and fought its neighbors and won over three wars.   The US props up Israel as well.   So basically western powers created a deal.  It wasn't accepted locally.   Israel won.  

Even Iran and Israel were allies when the US propped up the Shah of Iran for years.   The islamic revolution caused the overthrow of the regime in 1979 and Iran became and enemy of Israel and the US because in their opinion the west is deciding the fate of the region.

1620,"The Israeli state was formed 1948, meant to give Jews fleeing persecution in Europe their own state. it was meant to give Jewish people their own state. The unfortunate truth is that, foreign powers gave the Israeli state land that already belonged to Palestinians. Palestinians aren't exclusively Muslim. Back then it was Muslims, Jews, and Christians. The issue has been that once the State of Israel was formed, and backed by western powers, they began expanding voraciously claiming lands that were Palestinian as their own, and driving the indigenous people off of their land.   


This has been a long developing situation longer than the past 5 days. The Palestinian people have been suffering at the hands of the Israeli State for the past 75 years. in 2018 they protest peacefully every friday for almost 18 months. And the Israeli army massacred roughly 2-300 peaceful protesters. Hamas always believed in armed resistance to the Israeli state. The issue is called complex because of how much back and forth over the past 75 years, but it is simple. This situation started when land was illegally annexed by Israeli State.    


Since then Israeli State, has killed far more Palestinians, and has been backed by the US the entire time. Warcrimes committed by the Israeli State have been overlooked for reasons unbeknownst to me, and western powers have been turning a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis, afraid to blame the Israeli State. My guess is the fear of being called anti-semitic. The funding of the US has been extremely crucial in Israel Defense Forces ability to ""protect"" their lands from Hamas. So when people are saying Free Palestine, it is not meant to be a death to all jews, or kill all israelis. People are just asking that international law holds the Israel  State Accountable for its 7 decades of humans rights violations.   


Israeli officials are on record dehumanizing Palestinians, and have essentially told the world they are planning on committing more War Crimes in order to snuff out the remainder of Hamas. The israeli state is okay with killing Palestinian Civilians.

This whole thing has turned into such a sh!t show of hate, largely driven by people sitting on their couches, with zero stakes in the game, that it's disappointing to see.

Everyone seems to have abandoned their morals in order to do what benefits them most.  


As a Palestinian, I will always defend my people's right to live and right to determination. All of us Palestinians will. But now that this polarization has made standing up for basic Palestinian rights taboo in Israel, it feels that we are essentially being forced to stand against literally every Israeli political position, from Likud to Labor. They are forcing us to be the enemy, and it feels like any chance at peace for decades is gone. I'm even starting to rethink my position because of this.

I think that would be great if they could provide security for Palestinians as a third party and not as somebody that people hate. Then nobody will be firing on IDF members and the IDF not be abusing people out of frustration. But it's not going to work unless Hamas is disarmed. Hamas is the madman at everyone's door. 

Everyone is afraid of Palestinians until such time as Hamas is dead and people can think about them as just people again. Too many places see Palestinians as radicals and possibly dangerous, and it's not fair. I have many Palestinian friends in the US from college and from work, and they are afraid of Hamas. They are afraid that the social unrest will turn out badly for Palestinians in the end, even if a few people are not comfortable with how it has to be done. I hope they find some other ways out.

And we were still happy with just having a country where we can live without antisemitism especially after the hol0caust...

Israel always wanted peace, whenever they asked israel came and listened, look at egypt.
And even after all that israel has been through we managed to thrive and actually make inventions that are being used across the globe.
And even after all these peace declines with palestine we still gave them back gaza and we still give them water and electricity because h@mas, their so called ""resistance fighters"" use the money israel and europe give them to create more weapons.
They dug out the water pipes given to them and built by UNRWA as a body for their rockets.

Now you can know what actions you support and what not. For instance, I support Israel attacking the Gaza strip. I don't support the initial block on humanitarian aid and I don't support holding back any ""safe"" aid as a negotiation tactic and I support Israel's current decision to let a lot of aid come through egypt to incentivise people to go south.  I'm unsure to what I think about the fuel. Things are too complex for it to be one sided.

When you go online, there are many that will be against you, no matter what you say or do. People that justfiy what happened on the 07/10 do it either because either they are antisematic or they have a very simplistic and not nuanced way of looking at the conflict. ignore the negative vibes if you can and just write your mind knowing that there are many silent readers out there that learn from your more nuanced take on things. You can also go to subs that are more toward your opinion just to chill for a bit. I beilive that the best ""HASBARA"" you could do is just to say what you think. both because what you beilive in your eyes is the right thing so pushing people towards that is the best cause there is. and also because when you write geniunly, IMO, you're more convincing. And any take by every Israeli that's not entirely crazy is better than not. I beilive that while the IDF does a lot of bad things, they do not justfiy the 07/10 and that Hamas is a bad force for peace, even worst than Bibi (that also has to go and if he won't go after this I'll lose hope for our country)

The last thing to think of - Is that people and nations should be at least a little bit biased towards them or thier own citizens and it's OK. just like you don't donate all of your money to poor places in Africa, you have an obligation to look after yourself because nobody else would. so don't feel like being selfish is something bad, especially in the context of not wanting to die.

1657,"I feel the same way. I was born in Russia towards the end of the Soviet Union and migrated to the U.S. in the 90's. Even though I was a kid, there was a lot of hatred and violence thrown my way because I was Jewish. Also, what most people don't understand is that religion was illigal in the Soviet Union, so being ""Jewish"" was your ethnicity. Everybody's ethnicity was written in their passports. I also lived with my grandparents for much of my life, and am very aware of the kind of antisemitism they and their relatives faced. A lot of the antisemitism was also systemic. It was so much harder for Jewish people to get a job, get into school, have freedom of movement, etc. 

So, the current normalized antisemitism is just shocking to me, but not surprising. I feel like when the left started to demonize white people because of their skin color (nobody should be demonized because of their race!) the Jewish people were also demonized. Except that I feel like Jewish people were seen as ""worse"" than white. Jewish people were also not only left out, but demonized by the diversity/inclusion movement.

I have also seen Jewish people march on behalf of just about every cause except for their own, and that's a huge issue imo. And we don't see other groups that we have supported supporting us back. While all the other groups began standing up for themselves, we haven't done so at all. Even though there are a lot of Jewish writers and producers in Hollywood, there has been a complete erasure of the Jewish character, especially in multi-year shows which young people watch. Zionism has become a dirty word, when all it really means is that Israel has the right to exist, and if Jewish people feel threatened in the country where thy can reside, there is at least the hope that they can move to Israel and be saved.

It sounds pathetic of me to say, but there is nothing else I can do other than voicing my solidarity with you and all Israeli leftists who are caught between their own government's bellicose actions and the murderous Hamas, Hezbollah etc. whose only motivation is to annihilate Jews. Leftists who stand with Israel are in a difficult position in other countries too. In the US, if such leftists even exist, they are extremely marginalized and ostracized. In Germany, where both camps are almost equally large, leftists are splitting apart over this conflict. All this weakens leftist movements.

I guess I've been a two stater since I was a child, and I feel like I'm watching the people who should be working towards peace and self determination for everyone pull that further and further and further away in the name of reaching the simplest story.

I'm American, by happenstance of where and when my family fled. I grew up watching my country commit war crime after war crime in afghanistan and iraq. I watched this country boil over with bloodlust towards two places that hadn't even attacked us. I marched as a small child against this and watched it not matter. I learned what this country had done to vietnam, cambodia, laos, like most of central and south america. That this country exists at all is on the back of the attempted total annihilation of continent worth of culture, that is ongoing to this day. I wish I could like. Give you an answer on how you carry that.

But here, there is, there could be, a going forward. There are potential futures that are different. If people stop believing in them, no one will push for them, add their voices to them, think about them. Maybe its not two states, maybe its a confederation. Or some kind of unique communalist model. Maybe you can try to figure out how to retain self-determination and protections in a single democratic model.

Dialogue groups and human rights organizations on the ground there are going to need your help if you have it to give. I'm not fully up to date with which ones are doing what, and whose calling for what right now, but I know they're out there. Yesh Din is one that comes to mind off the top of my head?

We couldve settled for 50/50 after UN vote in 1947 when jews legally had half the land of israel.
And palestine got the best parts, close to jerusalem, mostly cities, jews got mostly deserts...
And we were still happy with just having a country where we can live without antisemitism especially after the hol0caust...
But no... barely 24 hours after the vote they went all out on israel.
And sadly for the war enthusiast criminals they lost.
Calling it ""the nakba"" bish they brought it on themselves.
And even afterwards israel offered 3 MORE TIMES! Offers of peace by bringing them land back, which they obviously refused because they hate jews...
Israel always wanted peace, whenever they asked israel came and listened, look at egypt.
And even after all that israel has been through we managed to thrive and actually make inventions that are being used across the globe.
And even after all these peace declines with palestine we still gave them back gaza and we still give them water and electricity because h@mas, their so called ""resistance fighters"" use the money israel and europe give them to create more weapons.
They dug out the water pipes given to them and built by UNRWA as a body for their rockets.
These are NOT resistance fighters, these are terrorists, beheading and r@ping the innocents.
Israel warns the civilians before bombing, what does h@mas do? Let their people live?

Despite having been present during terror attacks in the UK and Germany, and having lost friends in wars, it was never a feeling that I was in constant danger. I mean I know what it feels like to be under attack...

It must be a great strain on the psyche. I do think these human stories are incredibly important. I saw one woman who lost her child in the 7/10 attacks saying that she didn't want her child to be used as an excuse for vengance - and that the last thing Israel needs right now is war. I think there are many Israelis and Palestinians who would sympathize with this and do not want conflict. There will be Palestinians losing children and being angry at Hamas and blaming Hamas for the loss (even though what killed the child was an IDF bomb).

People get so caught up in the rhetoric in the media where political leaders and military action dominate the debate. Bibi and Gallant speak in such militaristic terms. Likewise, Palestinian leaders are strong in their condemnation of what is being done to them.

Careful what you absorb from media.  I'm not saying you should ignore what's going on, but the news coming out of Palestine is tailored to create the response you're describing.  That's not to say Israel shouldn't be held to account for any mistakes they make, because it's war, and mistakes will be made.  

Think about how that hospital bombing was reported.  ""Israel struck a hospital in Gaza killing 500"" was essentially being reported, but as the truth came out, it's now clear it was a Gazan weapon that landed near a hospital that killed something like 17.  

Not wanting Palestinians to die is noble, but it's also impractical.  The dense urban nature of Gaza and the willingness of Hamas to prop their citizenry up in front of any incoming fire makes that inevitable.  This is sad, but this is Hamas's doing.  If the Palestinian people were fed up with Hamas's behavior, they could mount a revolt and take back their nation.  The fact that they don't do that, leaves it to others. I'm grateful to have Israel in the world to do this.

I've posted this a few time, just to create some perspective:

* The first 36 hours of the Hamas attack killed 1400 people.  That's a kill rate of 38/hour.
* The first 3 weeks of bombing in a dense urban area killed 7000 people.  That's a kill rate of 14/hour.

For small arms fire to be twice as deadly as aerial bombing of a dense city, either it was particularly brutal, or the aerial bombing is taking drastic steps to avoid death.

1720,"Hi from a leftist pro-Palestine (aka pro peace) American Jew. First of all, I'm sorry for the trauma you have experienced, I know it must be very difficult to be under attack. The slaughter of 10/7 is horrible and Israeli people absolutely deserve to live in peace and be safe. We can all agree, murder and rape and terrorism are terrible things.

My belief is that the bombardment of Gaza is not actually making the Israeli people more safe. I don't think it will lead to the elimination of Hamas, because ideologies can't be killed, and the Isreali response is only serving to stir up more anti-Zionist sentiments.

I truly believe a diplomatic resolution is the only way to peace.

I think a lot of Israelis mistakenly believe that ""pro-Palestine"" must mean that people condone the Hamas attack, think Israel must stop existing, and that Israelis must be forced to leave and/or all Jews killed. I view all of this as a straw man argument. I think the vast majority of us favor a 2-state solution. However, Israel's constant re-negging on former peace treaties by using settlements and the militaristic control of resources in Palestine has emboldened Hamas towards violent action.

I have also observed a lot of racism and islamophoic prejudice among Israelis online. There is also prejudice against Israelis and Jews on the Palestinian side. What's happening right now is that both sides are spending all day viewing images of dead children on their social media feeds (or in real life) and both are becoming increasingly bigoted and hateful towards each other. The first step is for reasonable people on both sides to actually take a step back and humanize each other, seek to understand each other's perspectives, and stop making decisions based in fear and anger. I know it's hard when there is a lot to be scared and angry about, but I think hope and love are ultimately more powerful and inspiring.",2023-10-28 13:55:51

I have always been politically liberal, not an authoritarian. And Hamas is the opposite of democratic and this is what Westerners (and my fellow Americans) seem to have no clue about. 

The excessive Palestinian deaths don’t help anyone but Hamas leadership since they use it as Islamist propaganda. It all makes my stomach turn… I am very sensitive to cult mind control given my background and every time I look at Instagram it makes me a little depressed.

Most really have no clue about the history or nuances of the situation, or the ultimate aims of Hamas clearly stated in their 1988 charter.

Good news, for the most part. Palestinians just want a fair two state solution, they don't want to be ethnically cleansed. They're just trying to live and not watch their family slaughtered. They realise Israel holds the cards and they want to play ball. They just don't want to lose more, they just don't want Palestine to become history.

This idea that the destruction of Israel in its entirety is taking seriously by the left beyond sentiment or rhetoric is only true to a small margin. 

Palestinians voted for Fatah, it was Israel who funded Hamas and stoked division. Fatah just wants to go back to the UN agreed borders, they want to have a land bridge and things like air space and coast access and their own border control. Yknow - human rights stuff.

Like yeah, israel shouldn't exist, but it does, and people were born there. Germany probably won't offer Bavaria as a plan C any time soon, trump v2 has yet to offer Mexico.

We are voters in a democratic country, and that country often does things that we know are morally wrong, illegal and evil sometimes.

As voters in a democratic country, we know that we are morally responsible, at least partially, for ANYTHING our government does. And we know that the citizens of our country pay taxes into the government and military of our countries, so when our military bombs innocent people somewhere, we know that revenge violence could occur, and against us.

We also know that voting is done anonymously, so when our country kills people in our name, the people being attacked cannot know with precision who voted for that to happen. So they cannot have revenge in a precise way. 

All of the above is the moral dilemma of being in a democratic country, one where the political parties in power are themselves put into power because of different, powerful factions in society. As a leftist Israeli, I think you are NOT powerful, and instead the wealthy right-wing civilians in Israel are PRIMARILY responsible for the election and actions of the Israeli government and military. Netanyahu's right-wing party has used the military to seize more and more Arab territory.

Jews lived peacefully in Palestine, and across the arab world for thousands of years. Palestinians don’t take issue with the presence of Jews. It’s the presence of a Jewish supremacist state, on their native land, against their will.

The PLO accepted a two state solution in the 1990s. Israel just refuses to implement it. Palestinians are living like prisoners in their own country. What the hell do you expect.",2023-10-07 18:34:55

Since you brought the Holocaust into this, we can draw comparisons to the attack today and the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Desperate people who are unable to leave their open-air prison are going to revolt. It's terrible that so many Israelis died, but Israel's response killed more Palestinians today than Palestinians have killed Israelis in the past decade combined. 

It is, frankly, delusional to think Israel, especially under Bibi, is a partner for peace. He's called Palestinians animals repeatedly. He's said Israel is a country for its Jewish residents only. He clearly has genocidal intent and the only thing keeping a full-on genocide from happening is that he knows the world wouldn't put up with Israeli apartheid anymore if he did.",2023-10-07 21:06:43

Yes, holocaust was terrible, yes, many people died and are still dying because of Palestinians but just freely shooting civilians next to the border? Taking their homes? Civilians are the victims here, now Jews, sorry.

And I'm saying this as a polish person, my family was a victim of nazi terror long time ago as well.  


This conflict was there of decades, Jewish soldiers from Israel were VERY brutal last few years. Human Rights Watch even confirmed this: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/28/west-bank-spike-israeli-killings-palestinian-children)  


I'm very oppose to war, every polish person is, that's why in Westerplatte in Poland (place where german nazi soldiers attacked Poland 01/09/1939) we have a sign that says ""NIGDY WIECEJ WOJNY"" (War never again), but... well, I'm not surprised. The Palestinian Street want's Hamas, because they want their own country, their own freedom and that their people will be safe even if they are living next to the Jewish border posts. And Hamas promised them that.   


After the 1WW and the second world war many of the Jews came to Palestine, then united nations divided the Palestine into Jewish and Arab part, the Palestinians did not like it at all. Read about Nakba, the mass depopulation of palestinian villages in 1948, basically 80% of arab population had to leave their homes.   


Israel never went for any sort of agreement, never.   


I'm against of what is going right now, but I know why it is happening. And believe me, noone wants war.   


Also religion (which is fundamentally stupid reason, fighting for make believe things) is a big part of it, the biggest part is land.

'Rally co-organiser and speaker Fahad Ali claimed on Tuesday that NSW police failed to help shut down a 'minority' of people shouting antisemitic chants.

“I intervened to shut down antisemitic chants from a group of idiots who were in the minority,” he posted on Twitter. “Police told me to my face that they would not assist.”

Ali said the behaviour of that minority was “not only vulgar but completely selfish”.

“It has served as a distraction from the immense human suffering in Gaza and calls for genocide and collective punishment by Israeli officials.”

Fellow organiser Amal Naser said the young men taking part in the antisemitic chants were not part of the main group and had joined at the Opera House.

She tried to get police to move them on but “they put the onus on us to disperse them”.

“The police are there to help us create a peaceful rally and to help us coordinate [but] we were asked to disburse them ourselves, which is absolutely ridiculous,” she said.

She added: **“We absolutely condemn any form of antisemitism and it’s not associated to our movement. Our movement is an anti-racist and anti-colonial movement.”**'

1. I live in Sydney NSW. Our Police force has today been given “special powers” due to a Pro Palestinian gathering in Hyde Park THIS SUNDAY. Meaning that if I am in the area of said gathering, the NSW Police can demand my identity and arrest me for refusing. OR they could arrest me for for attending the rally. OR- for even walking through Hyde Park!!
This is a blatant restriction of my civil rights as a PEACEFUL AUSTRALIAN

2.The NSW Police responded appropriately in the short time they had to manage the Pro Palestinian rally that ended up at the Opera House. 

3.The lighting of the Opera House sails in the ISRAELI FLAG cost the people of NSW $100000.

4.Australians generally tolerate each other and live peacefully together. This violence is UNUSUAL in my Country and has stemmed from the hatred between HAMAS and the IDA

But what happends, after generation of suffering, is the rise of a certain mentality.
Antisemitism is surely of a twisted mentality among some people of palestine. But it cannot be compared to the antisemitism in Europe or America or elsewhere.
If Israelis where Christians, than their hate would be towards Christians, if they where blue, three eyed humanoids, than that would be their enemy.
People who don't live in Palestine and just blatantly support antisemitic narratives are as stupid as the ones who don't understand why some Palestinians hate Israelis.
Palestinians like any other Arab community are humans and humans can only endure so much before breaking. I am not in support of any side. But if I was held hostage in my own country and had to witness how people get bombed, humiliated, killed, raped and stripped from everything they have, I would be filled with hate too. The West is responsible for the suffering in the middle east, not only in Palestine. It has planted its seeds of evil everywhere around the world and puts the blame on others when it carries fruits.
The West has never shown sympathy for other cultures, like real, good hearted sympathy. Why should the victims care? Why should these people, who's only crime is being born in a man made shithole, feel sorry for anyone.
You should not start with the numbers game because it is not in favor of Israel. They have killed so many people that basically every palastinian has at least one family member murdered by the IDF or illegal settlers.
You should watch some footage of IDF soldiers proudly confirming the rape, murder and dislocation of civilians.

In 1917, the Ottoman Empire fell . During this England acquired what is present day Israel and the land that is currently being fought over.

They want to conquer and control and believe in ethnic cleansing this are not good people or people any of you support. Please keep this in mind. 

ENGLAND OCCUPIED THIS LAND from 1922-1949. England controlled it ran it and collected resources from it. It was theirs. 

England did shady things but long story short, they tried to pull a USA and try to be involved without being involved. They didn’t want to outwardly give the land to Israel so they essentially held it until Israel established themselves and when they established themselves England goes

2061,"This post falls short in both providing a comprehensive overview of historic peace processes/offers relevant to the conflict and in accurately portraying the history of the conflict as a whole. You conveniently ignore what peace proposals Arabs are officially sticking to (like the [Arab Peace initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Peace_Initiative) which I touched on in a [response to a very similar comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/13z68bl/comment/jmq0zn7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which I suspect you took and just added stuff near the end to), Zionist rejections of peace plans as well as context to say the peel commission which included Britain gaining a permanent Mandate over the Jerusalem area and ""corridor"" stretching to the Mediterranean coast at Jaffa—and the land under its authority, as well as Jews/Zionists being iffy about it. But since you find it convenient to mention Hamas' actions, and not exclusively peace proposals, why start at 1937 and cherry-pick misleading information where you make it seem like Palestinians were only rejecting peace proposals and were only engaged in terrorism? You don't even try to cover pretty much any of the history of Zionism, Arab/Palestinian nationalism, the Mandate, Zionist terrorist organizations, everything in Lebanon, the settlements (except in passing) etc. I'm gonna pick a random peace offer you mentioned:

>2008: Israel offers Mahmoud Abbas once again recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital and even offered to dismantle all their settlements. And once again, the Palestinians reject it.

East Jerusalem was not offered as it's capital. The most they were actually told to get:

""According to one of the documents, the Palestinian Authority was prepared to concede most Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, as well as the Armenian Quarter, with the exception of Har Homa. The Temple Mount would be temporarily administrated by a joint body consisting of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States until a permanent solution was reached.\[23\]""

(from Palestine Papers article linked below)

And the Times of Israel said that Olmert ""proposed that the “Holy Basin” be overseen instead by a five-member, non-sovereign international trusteeship, comprising Israel, the PA, Jordan, the US and Saudi Arabia."" (article linked below).

More information:

""According to Al Jazeera, Abbas was not allowed to keep the unofficial map, so he sketched it by hand. During the first of several meetings, the Palestinian Authority proposed a land swap, offering Israel the opportunity to annex all of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem in return for land concessions by Israel. Olmert, however, offered no concessions in return but an even more aggressive land swap.\[24\]

In Prime Minister Olmert's own proposal, Israel would annex 6.3% \[25\] of the West Bank. The land in Olmert's map included the four settlements of Gush Etzion (with Efrat), Ma'ale Adumim, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ariel, in addition to all settlements in East Jerusalem (Har Homa). In exchange for those concessions by the Palestinian Authority, Olmert offered 5.8% \[25\] of Israeli land as part of the swap. The land offered consisted of lightly populated farmland, which would be divided between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused. Mahmoud Abbas sketched Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration.\[26\] This map was then later referred to as the Napkin map.\[24\]

The third and final meeting occurred on 16 September 2008. It was during this time that Ehud Olmert was nearing the end of his political career. At the time, Olmert was under police investigation for alleged corruption that had occurred while he was Mayor of Jerusalem, and as a result of the accusations was not planning on running again. During the final meeting, Mahmoud Abbas was prepared by the Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) to clarify many questions regarding Ehud Olmert's peace plan in which Abbas was quoted as asking questions such as ""How do you see it addressing our interests, especially as Ariel, Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Homa and Efrat clearly prejudice contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine?"" as well as others about the value of the land that they would receive in such a swap in terms of value and size.\[24\]

The Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) also insisted that Prime Minister Olmert provide them with a copy of the map, which was again denied. In the end, however, Mahmoud Abbas asked for a few days to consider the offer. A day after this meeting, Olmert resigned and Tzipi Livni stepped in as Acting Prime Minister, with Benjamin Netanyahu being elected shortly afterward. Palestinian negotiators said Abbas had forgotten another appointment and postponed the next meeting. Netanyahu thought Olmert had made too many concessions and refused to continue from where the last round of negotiations had left off, preferring to restart the negotiations from the beginning.""

Obviously I don't have enough time to dissect literally everything you've mentioned, but I hope this explains why your framing can be reductive.

What I'm more curious about is why you think any of this means 'being pro-Palestine is the same as not knowing history.' You don't actually provide a reason, you've just likely copy-pasted the same misleading stuff someone else wrote and added your own new relevant bits about Hamas at the end, pretending like it's an accurate summary of the history of the conflict when it isn't, it is a misleading overview of the peace process where you only find it convenient to mention actions from Palestinians that have nothing to do with the peace process and just help paint them in a bad picture exclusively, ignoring the Israeli side.",2023-10-11 08:31:08
2062,"As Ben Gurion himself put it:

""I don't understand your optimism. Why should the Arabs make peace? If I were an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country. Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. We come from Israel, it's true, but two thousand years ago, and what is that to them? There has been anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. Why should they accept that?""",2023-10-11 09:22:50

There are hundreds upon hundreds of millions of Muslims on earth, the Arab population is almost 500 million. Jews represent 16 million of the world population. Do Israelis kill random Muslim people all over the world just to make a point? They could certainly do so, but they don’t. Hamas is no different from Isis and every other terrorist organization that takes innocent life to make a point. Terrorists are defined by one thing: they live to defy ethical norms and terrorize people into compliance. The people of Gaza may be the best example of what it means to be the bargaining chip of terrorists. Their suffering can literally be translated into “money for terrorists.” There’s only so much history one needs to know to differentiate between good and evil. After that, it’s on you, and if you want to be on the side of terrorists who terrorize their own people, go for it.

The formation of a Jewish state was the promise of Britain thru the Balfour Declaration which also promised a homeland alongside the Palestinians.   The end of WWI saw the breakup of the Ottoman Empire territories in Africa and the Middle east to allow Western European powers to expand their colonial holdings over the Arab World.   

The League of Nations passed the Mandate for Palestine which saw Britain overseeing the territory of Palastine and TransJordan.   The initial proposal under UN resolution 181 saw 62% of the Land go to the formation of Israel while the population of Palestinians was double the population of Jewish Settlers.   It took extensive Jewish Lobbying and Extenstive Pressure by Truman and the United States to get member countries to vote for the resolution.   Yes the resolution was voted against by the Arab League and the Arab World.    The plan was biased against the Arab World.  A civil war broke out which resulted in a large number of Palestinians fleeing the territories that would become Israel.

UN Resolution 194 also grants the rights of the Palestinians the right to re-occupy lands taken during the Mandate and successive wars. 

The Western World has imposed its will on the Arab world in the formation of the countries that were formed post WWI without really consulting the peoples living their.   That is a huge basis for anger and hatred towards the west.",2023-10-11 10:23:40

It’s so infuriating on a level. 

None of them think they need to study or research this conflict and all the different aspects to it- like read the Hadiths for one.. that’s probably the most labor intensive but it’s so necessary to really grasp what the Jews are dealing with. 

Then going over the history, what happened.

The hypocrisy is just driving me nuts. 

Like .. they’re so dumb they don’t even know what they’re saying. 

Like even if you believed everything they said - 

Israel took their houses from them. Took their land. They all like to use this example - 
“What if you woke up one day and your country was another country and you had to leave your house and all your belongings by gun point?”

Now the fact that nothing like this ever happened and in fact the Muslims declared war on the Jews before any legal borders could even be established for Israel after the land was awarded to the Jews- doesn’t matter. Grrrrr.. ( so fucking irritating but ok) 

Let’s say all that happened. 

( and the fact that this really did happen and much worse to the Jews during WW 2 - like they were rounded up at gun point, had to evict their houses, all their stuff and money was stolen, they were put into camps and exterminated - but that doesn’t seem to dawn on them that so much worse happened to the Jews and the Jews only wanted a safe place to go after that) 

Let’s say the Palestinian people didn’t declare war on the Jews in 1948 and borders were established and they woke up one day and had everything stolen from them and their houses taken away and forced to move somewhere else. Worst case right ?

Ok so you go and kill children ? You go and intentionally target babies, families, kids? 

You stab children? You burn babies alive ? You strap bombs to your chest and kill as many civilians as you possibly can .. 

Really? 

Ok so let’s even go further - if the Jews went though much 10000x worse than what the Muslims did - no we can’t go there. 

So basically millions of people around the world think it’s ok to kill kids if they get robbed. Lol. 

It’s just so crazy how all of it is so twisted and so turned around and so ironic and so hypocritical and so wrong - it’s just insane .. totally bat shit insane. On so many levels. 

I feel so strongly about it that anyone coming out against Israel is dead to me. I just can’t tolerate that level of stupidity and ignorance- and if you’re that dumb that you have an opinion about it you blast and don’t know that you don’t know anything about it - like don’t know the history, don’t know the facts, don’t know the Hadiths -

Videos being disseminated by a terrorist organization are being taken as absolute truth while anything Israel releases is a flat out lie generated to further their “genocidal” mission. 

There seems to be almost no gray area in these circles which is frightening. I’m not here to say that Israel is 100% right in their treatment of Gazans or anything to that effect.

I don’t think it helps that’s for the first 2 weeks or so, the only videos we saw were innocent hurt and dead Gazans. (ETA, I not only follow more individuals on the Right than I do Left, but was also specifically seeking out videos from the Oct 7th attack, and there were little to none at that time) Hamas did a really good job pumping this stuff out to sway public opinion, and it worked/is working. 

It took literally weeks before the horrific videos of innocent Israelis being ruthlessly murdered began surfacing and circulating. 

By then, sadly, the people you describe in OP had already made up their minds, and are willing participants in, quite frankly, being brainwashed. 

In addition, the seed was already planted in many Leftists a few years back. I shamefully don’t know what sparked it, but I think it was in 2021 when celebs and such were preaching to free Palestine. 

Hamas are terrorists, and what they’ve done and are doing is horrific. Hamas apologists seem to justify the terror as ‘necessary’ to ‘free Palestine’. It’s possible to want change for Palestine, and also acknowledge that Hamas is disgusting for killing innocent Israelis and Palestinians. 

I also see ‘pro-Israel’ individuals who show no compassion for innocent murdered Gazans. They justify their deaths by saying they are necessary casualties to take out Hamas. It’s possible to condemn Hamas while also acknowledging it’s not right to take out civilians with them. 

I’m not sure why everyone seems to be so black and white nowadays and throw nuance out the window entirely. I don’t want to see any innocent murdered, no matter who did it or why. I don’t claim to know what should be done differently, however.

They don't like seeing water and food cut off like Israel first did and only allowing now pauses or small amounts of stuff in bc of pressure it seems.  HOW ISRAEL RESPONDS MATTERS.   And we now are all looking at the issues that have been going on there.  If a bad guy or guys was holding a town, or hospital or school hostage, or using innocents or children as ""human shields"" would anyone think OK to drop bombs and obliterate the entire area and say ""oopsy, sorry they were using them as shields.""     You speak of insane?? that is what sounds insane to me.

What is their objective anyway, I want to know, I'll wait.   You mean kill ALL Hamas? How would they even know they killed all Hamas.  Do they believe they have them all trapped in the tunnels up north?  So their plan is to obliterate the entire north of Gaza?  Will they stop there?  Since right now they are only killing about 20% or so of actual  Hamas, how many more civilians will that take.  Is Hamas 40K?  You don't see the inhumane insanity of this?  Won't this breed more Hamas?   Shouldn't they try something else?  We need a ceasefire and negotiations put on the table.  They are making no effort in anything like that or anything else except the easy way, to drop bombs including on hospitals and play up the bs inhumane talking point, they were using them as human shields.  

That does not make one Pro Palestine. I am pro humanity and sane responses to horror like Hamas attack.    But also I want to know why Hamas exists in the first place, what breeds this horror.

They infiltrated the education system. Mainly universities, but not only. So many of the lecturers, especially in non-scientific circles, are far-left and anti-Israel activists. These professors and lecturers use the freedom of speech combined with their position of power over students to doctrinate them into their own belief system. There was one case where a professor of asian studies offered bonus points to students that joined an anti-Israel protest! If that is not utter abuse of power, I don't know what is. It's so much worse than a professor having an affair with a student.

Anyway, they are now well positioned in these institutions, and their affect on the world view of the younger generation is astonishing. Add to that social media, especially Tik-Tok, and the vast number of people in the world that hate the west, these are so easily abused to promote misinformation and indoctrination.

Straight white male has become a swear word in these circles. I've seen white students APOLOGIZE FOR BEING WHITE! The world is going crazy, and I'm not sure what can be done to stop it. For one, I believe that lecturers and professors in universities must be banned from political propaganda, just like they are banned from having romantic relationships with students.

2202,"Hello, I'm part of the western left, but I don't think I fit your characterisation. I'm not trying to be inflammatory, but I don't think you're right in saying it's all anti semitic propaganda. 

I think Hamas should get out of Gaza, and be dispatched quickly, they're a militia, they're dangerous ANd they don't take care of their people. But I also don't think that dropping hundreds of bombs a day is a good way to deal with them??? Israel is creating new combatants everyday by killing civilians and their families. 

You observe, where are the protests about Hamas? And my answer would be that the current actual carpet bombing of a city, mostly children seems a little more pressing. I would respond back, How is killing the civilians, again mostly children going to create a new governing body? And if it did how would that governing body want to work with the people who just killed their families in the thousands?  It seems to me that following up horrific attacks with war crimes doesn't put Israel in the right? 

I understand we think that Hamas is under the city, so how is bombing the city going to hurt them? What is the end here? Like Israel will bomb the city until there is no one left to govern? No one left to oppose them? My question for Israel and for people who support them would be how many people dead do we think is enough to vanquish Hamas? 10k? 20k? A million? All I'm saying is that's not a calculation I think has any place in a world with peace. I don't think you get to be the good guys any more if you're attacking civilians. Hamas and Israel included.

THAT SAID I don't really know what the solution is here. There have been attempts at peace. Both sides are angry and are attempting to use violence to get the other side to capitulate and get what they want. 

I will talk it out with anyone who can keep their cool. I'm only becoming aware of the depth of the conflict so if you have insights or want to push back on anything that's ok.

Adam Zaidel, of the the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar-Ilan University explains how the brain processes new information, and wonders how people can receive full evidence about the Hamas attack and yet come to incorrect beliefs.

The brain makes decisions on 3 factors:

1.  begin with prior beliefs

2.  update with new evidence

3.  how reliable we think the new evidence is

Example: The hospital bombing in Gaza

1.  Prior Belief:  It MUST be Israel

2.  New evidence from NYT

3.  NYT is reliable so it must be true.

""Don't bother me with the facts."" Jordanian foreign minister says no one will believe that a Hamas rocket backfired ""in this part of the world."" (It's as if they have a shield on their brains that keeps the truth from entering.)

The presumption that people observe the facts and come to logical conclusions is just wrong. (So many of us are wasting our time presenting the facts since we won't be considered a reliable source by our opponents.)

Decisions are driven by prior beliefs without the facts and subjective biases about the facts about who is reliable.

2232,"I have spent hours, day and night since Oct 7th, and I am not blind to what's been happening over the past 75 years. I am not blind to what's happening in Gaza because I follow the journalists who are out there, the nurses and doctors who share their stories, and the children and civilians holding press conferences begging for the world to see them as humans and not terrorists/Hamas. I believe that removing Palestinians from their homes to get to Hamas is false and the bigger picture is ethnic cleansing. I cannot sleep and I wake up checking my phone to make sure those I follow have not died. I watch as most if not ALL of them lose someone important to them. My heart aches. I see the bigger picture every day and I pray I am wrong at that real actions are taken to protect civilians in Gaza. I don't understand why they cannot get humanitarian aid and if they did why so late and so little? I see the bigger picture is to remove them from their land and their beaches, and take what Israel feels is so much more rightfully theirs. I feel pain by how the IDF just casually celebrates when the only people I see dead a children, civilians and entire families wiped out - at most I saw 42 (now at least 43) family members. I am shocked and how little empathy humanity holds within them, and how quick people are to justify genocide. I am stressed but I am not going to let that keep me quiet. I grew up horrified by the Holocaust, we visit the museum, and spent a large amount of our curriculum learning this as children. To this day, I cry at any story/movie/interview about the genocide of Jews between 1933-1945. To me, grouping up Palestinians in Gaza and making them equivalent to Hamas is downright bullsh\*t. That's like all of America turning against all white civilians in our country because of the January 6 terrorist attacks at the White House. I mean it really fucking is. But everyone is so brainwashed and all they care about is having power and control over those who don't think like them. I don't know.

2233,"These constant right versus left posts regarding Israel make no sense to me, when talking about the Western hemisphere. Being ""far left"" or ""far right in Israel, is NOT the same as being ""far left"" or ""far right"" in the western world. The most vocal antisemitic groups in the USA are alt-right groups. They hate Jews, blacks, and essentially almost anyone who isn't white and Christian. These groups probably see this war as the perfect opportunity to fuel both antisemitism and Islamophobia and are capitalizing on it as much as they can, while everyone points fingers at the left. I would be far more concerned about them than a bunch of students protesting on campus.

I also get the feeling that the people who keep complaining about the ""Western left"" either don't understand the distinction, or are doing it disingenuously for the purpose of fabricating a political divide that really does not exist. Or they are doing it with the intent of making the left seem radical and extreme. In the same way that politicians like Sanders, Warren and sometimes even Biden, were labelled as ""radical left"" to scare people into voting Republican. None of the news outlets in the USA that veer left have shown a single ounce of support for Hamas. They have also made a point of interviewing as many survivors of October 7th, so that people see how horrible it was.  And last I checked, the currently Democrat-run government seems to be fully behind Israel, so why all these posts about the left?

It is also very disingenuous for people on this sub to say that the same people who were supposedly cheering after October 7th are the same people who are currently opposing Israel's response to Gaza. But rather than try to understand why students on these campuses are concerned for the state of Palestinians, it is easier to call them ""far left"" or Hamas supporters or worst, antisemitic. Most people I know were absolutely horrified by what happened on October 7th. But they are also very disturbed by the way Israel is responding and feel empathy for the people in Gaza.

Because there  IS propaganda coming out of Israeli government (just listen to them speak). A lot of misinformation or information out of context is going on all sides. Both maliciously and also, sheer ignorance. 

This is a heavy subject for anyone from the general region and has been for awhile. I think, for a lot of western people, they’re realizing how little they knew and a guilt at their own complicity. I don’t think this is conscious of course, but I think ~ white guilt ~ is at play here a bit. 

But also, 30 days of bombing. No food, no water (I know aid trucks are goin in, but not enough and very late). Electricity is being cut off. Hospitals and churches aren’t even safe? That is insane, no matter what or who started it. You don’t have to believe the death count numbers but you do have to believe mass civilian deaths are occurring. It being live streamed every day (when they have internet).

This is not a focused attack. This is not a targeted one. Hostages are also dying because of these attacks. Who are these reckless attacks good for? 

This “day after” as they keep alluding to, even if they get all Hamas targets, they’ve incited so much terror in the people (and in the West Bank as well. You don’t even have to believe the settler attack, just watching their fellow Palestinians being bombed and destroyed because of a group of political extremists’ actions).

The fight is not about Hamas, and focusing on protestors being pro Hamas, you’re loosing site of the a newer, likely more pissed off version of Hamas that being created.

But the main thing is that whilst Hamas did terrible things, many of the casualties were military. Israel has been slaughtering children, and commiting the international warcrime: Collective punishment. The majority of Palestinians don't like Hamas. Also in areas of Palestine where Hamas are not active, Palestinians are still being killed. the West Bank has been militarily occupied for 25 years after they promised to leave.

I think I've had a few useful conversations on here. I've reached out to some people I know and asked them what they meant and tend to find many people, in private hold different positions than their posts would have you believe.

My sister was in the attack and I was on the phone with her during the whole time that she was hiding inside a toilet. The most terrifying 7 hours of my life. Screaming and crying and calling the whole world to find someone to rescue her from there.
Couldn’t do anything.
And later on seeing the whole world justifying the horror. She described seeing so many friends of her just falling down from gunfire, people who 20min ago she was dancing with - are tortured dead or kidnapped. 
Few days later people shouting “gas the Jews”, “from the river to the sea..” and other antisemitic things. I hear my sister on national tv saying “Netanyahu and Ben Gvir, our blood is on your hands “ later, her boyfriends parents screaming at her “how could you say that” “you are no longer invited to our house”. Few days later I hear about more and more friends of mine who’s relatives are murdered or kidnapped.
Later I see videos of Palestinian bodies in Gaza. I see protests in Ramallah calling any Arab in the West Bank to take guns and shoot the Jews. I am located 14km from Ramallah, in Jerusalem.
I see the numbers of Palestinian people dying raising up and feel so sorry for any unnecessary lost as I see and know how terrible it is to lose your loved ones. I see videos from the 7th of October of citizens from Gaza, not Hamas, citizens, threatening families of rape and kidnapping and killing. I know my country can not allow a group who did what they did on 7/10 to stay in power because it will cause death of more and more people, and I can only imagine how hard it is for Gaza a right now.

2289,"I agree with your sentiment, but disagree with some of the specifics.

I am genuinely baffled at people who scream ""ISRAEL IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVILS THEY ARE COMMITTING GENOCIDDDEEEE"" without mentioning the context. The context genuinely is important because it reveals who is causing these deaths/who is at fault.

Hamas is a jihadist terrorist group that wants to obliterate Israel, all of its citizens, and all Jews everywhere. They want to establish an ISIS style state on Israeli/Palestinian land. Hamas went in with the stated intention of killing as many Jews and Israelis as possible in the most barbaric ways possible and killed 1400 people and has 233 hostages who they are using as bargaining chips. Given Hamas' intentions and the fact that they're terrorists who have broken ceasefires before, Israel has no choice but to defend itself. Israel is not going in with the intention of killing innocents. If you deny this, you are disingenuous and/or brainwashed. Israel has dropped leaflets, made phone calls, sent texts, etc... all warning people to get the hell out of the area. What does Hamas do? They tell people to stay and actually prevent people from leaving at times. They also have their operating headquarters in an active hospital!!! Additionally, Egypt and all other countries have refused to allow people into their countries, which they could do safely if they really wanted to. Israel has been completely trapped by terrorists and despots.

It's fine if you hate and criticize Israel (They probably deserve some criticism) and it's fine if you want a ceasefire, but omitting these facts and many others I didn't mention makes you completely disingenuous and makes me question your motives. Why are people not screaming for the Egyptians to help? Why are people not screaming for Hamas to surrender? Why are people not screaming for Hamas to not use its citizens as human shields? Why are people not screaming at Hamas to move their headquarters out of an active hospital? Why are people not screaming at Hamas to stop misleading people on where to go for safety?

The endless cycle of 'we are not in the wrong for killing all these children, because our enemy did something even worse' is perhaps the best way to explain why the region is in so much trouble.

I live in a part of the world which has born witness to some of the Worlds most atrocious incidents, and during the last three generations, we have actively chosen peace, even if it meant surrendering sovereignty and privilege. It is evident that the peace we are experiencing here is something my grandparents and their parents have worked incredibly hard to create and maintain, it's not something you demand, it's something you take responsibility for, even if it takes compromise.


I weep for the civilians on both sides, as until the fundamental mindset in both Palestine and Israel changes, I can't see this change and children will continue to be born into the most horrible of situations.


Both sides talk about the conflict as something they're unable to control and stop, when the reality is they are the **only** ones who can make it stop.

Given that Hamas has stated that is it's intention, Israel is allowed to use whatever force is necessary to eliminate that threat. When the allies retaliated against Germany (or Japan) in WWII, was anyone telling them to be careful not to hurt civilians?  While civilian casualties are tragic, the blame for that lies on Hamas not Israel.  Hamas is their government and they started a war and sadly the civilians will also pay a heavy price, but Israel is allowed to do whatever is necessary to wipe out the enemy and win the war.  Shocking that people think Israel should fight nicely and also supply the enemy with fuel, water and medical supplies, while Hamas follows no rules and has taken billions of dollars from Iran and others to build tunnels and stockpile weapons as part of its plan to wipe Israel off the map.

How could people let this happen and live with themselves? How could people stand for something so barbaric as this? However, i'll try my best to comfort you with the things that helped me personally.

This is the way of the war. This isn't the first time it's happening. Yes, maybe you're experiencing it for the first time (I am too, btw) and that's why you're not able to cope with it. But it has happened many times before, and many more people have been killed in vain. Maybe the world views them as 'martyrs' who died with dignity and shi, but no. Reality is they were killed in vain, for nothing, like ants crushed under someone's feet. And this is the bitter reality, one must come to terms with war otherwise, they'll be driven insane by its consequences.

You might be feeling sick thinking that there are people there who openly support hamas or openly support Israel, but know that no sane person is happy with the killings happening on the other side. Maybe they support it politically, they might think it's the appropriate solution but they're not celebrating death. Nobody is bloodthirsty. It's a painful pill but ultimately, it had to be done sooner or later. Now you and I might be sitting in another part of the world, saddened by what's happening there, depressed by the videos of Gaza and all. But look, honestly those people (Both Israelis and palestinians) have invited this upon themselves. Both sides have done lot of messed up things, this isn't about weighing one's mistakes against the other. They're both wrong and they are reaping the fruits of their actions, nothing else. It's all karma and in the end, everything will be fair, trust this fact. 

If you are saddened by the death of innocent people, just know or believe that wherever they are, they're in a better place than this hell that these people have created on Earth. Finally, they have been liberated from their sufferings and plight. And everyone will be held accountable in the end. Just feel incredibly blessed that you are in a country where people value each other's lives. Just thank God, that this isn't happening to you.

Lastly, revenge is a terribly stupid motive for a country to attack. No government makes decisions like that. Israel is not attacking because they want revenge.

2439,"The truth is, you want Israel to bomb a hospital. You want innocent people to die so that it fits with your narrative of Israel the conquer and destroyer of innocent Palestine. 

In reality, Israel is not bombing a hospital. At the first word of the story, every bullshit detector in the world should of gone off. Not dismissing it completely, as mistakes happen and we've seen first world militaries commit atrocities, but that's a bold claim that requires real evidence. No problem being skeptical of the IDF, but have some evidence before believing terrorists. 

A statement from Hamas is not evidence. Even if the most wanted members of Hamas were in that hospital, Israel is more likely to raid then bomb. But even if they did bomb it, the building would be rubble. You would guarantee target death. Have you seen IDF strikes? Building goes bye bye in a cloud of dust. In fact I saw people using Israeli videos showing a building getting completely eviscerated claiming it was the hospital attack. This was a small impact, large fire, killing civilians camping in a parking lot. The hospital is barely scathed. You were wrong. 

Even yesterday, with the multiple angles and geolocated footage, the most logical explanation was a failed rocket. The burn out never indicated missile strike. Hmmm. Hamas was shooting loads of rockets at the time. These are not GPS guided bombs from F16s, but agricultural pipes stuffed with fertilizer. And guess what? When you shoot 5000 homemade rockets over a densely populated area, something is bound to go amuck. Hamas accidentally killed their own people sheltering at a hospital. The world cared hard when the IDF caused their deaths, but now that the facts are emerging and it is clear that it was Hamas, its just an ""oops, my bad.""  Nobody is protesting against Hamas for burning women and children alive today. Their casualties turned from reason for worldwide revolt, to just the cost of war. And thats the saddest part. These people are just pawns in a political power struggle. Half of the people that claim to care about them truly do not. You are just seeking anti-Israeli news and thought you had a good one there.

Killing a lot of innocent people without decapitate children, and bombed a lot of innocent people without killing the exact number they other side claimed at certain sites is still too much.

And Yes, I think Hamas definitely lied about the hospital, for sure, but by how much, remain to be seen. They sound comparison between JDAM missile and the footage at the hospital is convincing enough for me to believe it was a Israeli missile,  but the evidence on the other side is also pretty convicing.

""UN chief António Guterres condemned “clear violations of international law” in Gaza as the US added to mounting pressure on the Israeli government to pause its bombardment of the besieged coastal enclave and allow in more aid. In his toughest remarks so far about the conduct of the war in the Gaza Strip, Guterres told the UN security council on Tuesday that the safety of civilians was paramount. “Protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields,” the secretary-general said, adding that it “does not mean ordering more than 1mn people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself”. Guterres also said that the deadly assault by Palestinian militant group Hamas on southern Israel on October 7 “did not happen in a vacuum”. “The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,” he added, though he said their grievances could not justify the “appalling attacks”.""

What is undisputed is that this dense strip of land filled with civilians has been indiscriminately bombed until it almost no longer exists, that 111 schools, medical buildings, refugee camps filled with kids and exit points that Israeli instructed on national news channels that Palestinians head towards have been bombed.

2512,"It’s understandable that people would conflate radical Zionism that kind of looks like terrorism in some instances with run of the mill zionism that just wants Israel to exist in some form. I assume that run-of-the-mill Zionism would feel weird about Jerusalem. Tel Aviv is less at risk for conflicts compared to Jerusalem. 

Radical Zionism is the type of thought process, from my view, that you should get closer into the West Bank and invite conflict for whatever reason. It’s probably some sort of extreme religious ideology. 

It’s not normal. Neither is believing that Israel should not exist and taking Hamas’s side like erdogan and calling Hamas fighters freedom fighters as the parade around with dead bodies of civilians on the backs of pickup trucks. It may be somewhat of a false equivalence in terms of the brutality, but it’s the same sort of thing. Hamas wants you to believe that they represent Palestinians, and these radical zionists want people to believe that they are Israel.

In the same way that a lot of pro-Israel people feel that “from the river to the sea” is a fairly innocuous phrase that means something much more awful like all Jewish people should be killed, anti-zionists take when people say “zionists” to mean this sort of radical Zionism that doesn’t say the quiet part loud. That it expresses support for the radical zionists aggressive behaviors. Other phrases like “Israel has a right to defend itself” fall under the same umbrella. Some people simply mean that Israel should be allowed to retaliate to protect themselves, others mean that Israelis should be able to do settlements, encourage conflict, deprive Palestinians of their voting rights, and kill Palestinians bc them having babies is an existential threat to having an ethnostate. Believe it or not, these are real feelings of some radical Zionists. 

They make Israel look bad when they are not condemned just as Hamas makes Gaza and all Palestinians look bad when they are not condemned. They look enabled. 

As for the idea that Israel is a safe place for Jewish people, I don’t know how you could think that. There are many safer places for Jewish people. Not saying that there shouldn’t be an Israel, it just feels like the idea that Israel is a safe place despite being under the constant threat of war does not make it a safe place. I think it’s mostly religious reasons and, if not that, it’s just the fact that people grew up there and that’s just their nationality.",2023-11-17 16:30:48

2529,"People use the term out of ignorance, but also out of a lack of any good term existing for Jewish nationalists. People who don't know what it means presume that Zionism is specifically the radical arm of it. I myself have been guilty of using it this way. Heck, I knew genocide historians who think Zionism is specifically radical nationalism. Many people think when they hear Zionist that it is referring to the idea that Israel ""Should be the whole land between the Sea and the Rivers.""

I ask you this, if Zionism is ""generally agreed to be the belief that the State of Israel should exist as a Jewish country. "" who has ""generally agreed"" upon that? Because I know any number of pro-Israel allies who also think that Zionism has become synonymous with the radical version of the ideology. Language changes. People who say they are Anti-Zionist are generally of the opinion that Israel has a right to exist and there is a need for a Jewish homeland where Jews can be free- something that would be Zionist in the definition you present. But they want to illustrate a lack of support for colonialist practices in Palestine in a neat word.

This is very much a linguistic point more than anything else. Zionism's definition has changed in the wider global population. Most people out of the loop associate Zionism specifically with extremism. As much as it used to mean one thing, you can't change how language evolves. People needed a word to describe Jewish nationalism and Zionism became that word. Nobody decided it. it wasn't an anti-semitic conspiracy. It's just language change",2023-11-18 18:57:08

2531,"I’ve learned that Zionism means different things to different people. To my Palestinian friend, whose family was displaced in ‘48, “Zionism is the reason my family are refugees”. 

I had no idea growing up as a diaspora Jew that Zionism was a dirty word to some. I held a story of ‘they always hated us and wanted us dead, then the holocaust happened, then we got Israel (hooray) and they keep attacking us cause they want us dead but Israel is good’. (This is years of Hebrew school and family dinners condensed). 

As I now understand, Zionism does have a lot of skeletons in its closet. The founders were very determined to make it happen at any cost, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were killed or displaced in its name,and even today, right now in this war, so many Palestinians are dying because of Zionism. 

I agree with another commenter that we can’t measure the validity or ethics of things done in the past by the standards of today. I’m not so sure Israel would have been created the way it was, in 2023. But Israel does exist, (and this is a very good thing for an historically persecuted people) and Israel should continue to exist and its people should be protected. 

By the OPs comments, my last statement makes me a Zionist. And yet I can’t quite commit to being a Zionist, not when I see the things happening in Zionism’s name, and when we equate anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, as a Jew, I can’t support Israel as it is, in my name. 

I notice that zionists brush off Israel’s aggression. ‘Sure there are a few settlers’ ‘I don’t like Netanyahu’, but then go on to defend Israel, at any cost. But what is a nation if not its people, its government, its borders?? Israel elected Netanyahu to be in power for 14 years and allows the settlers (not just a few!) to expand in the West Bank and make life worse for Palestinians. It must be easy for a regular Israeli to enjoy a peaceful life in prosperity and under the iron dome, and not worry much about these ‘scuffles’, but they are not fringe elements to the people living in oppression under them. Hey, I live a charmed life too and don’t rise up to every call against oppression in my country, I’m just noting how easy it is to not consider the very real pain of ongoing oppression when you don’t have to live it. This oppression comes under the umbrella of ‘Zionism ’, it’s the actions and inactions of Israel, and the world is calling it out. 

Yes I know hamas is awful, they make life miserable for their own people etc. I know. I don’t know how to get through to hamas, but my Jewish values propel me to want more to be done by Israel. For me to call myself a Zionist, I want to know that the country I’m supporting is doing everything it can to be peaceful and humanitarian. I just can’t see how 11000 people killed were all inevitable. I don’t know how to tell my friend, who’s 23 family members were killed in the south of Gaza (as directed by the Israeli government for their own safety) that Israel was just defending itself against terrorism. Until then, I just can’t call myself a Zionist. 

Judaism has a long and beautiful (and painful) history, and this has created a strong, resourceful, and deeply connected people, over thousands of years and now around the world. I love being Jewish, the sense of community is beautiful. Zionism is about 100 years old. Judaism predates Zionism, and my Jewishness does not have to equate Zionism.

2535,"Why do Jewish people have a right to their own state?

I think this is a good, usually completely overlooked question. If you ask a Jewish person, they will generally say that every ethnicity has a homeland, and therefore Jewish people should also be entitled to a homeland. I think that's a terrible argument because it doesn't actually answer the question; why does any ethnicity deserve a homeland?

The other position you'll hear often is that due to historical subjugation and expulsion, the Jewish people need a majority-Jewish (totally not an ethnostate) state in order to ensure their survival as an ethnic people.

The latter is, to me, the more convincing argument, but I still don't think it's necessarily a good argument - namely because I don't think ethnostates necessarily have a right to subjugate other groups in order to maintain a certain demographic and culture within their society. For instance, the Jewish state has to be run by a majority Jewish body and maintain a majority Jewish population in order to preserve the ethnic purity of their society and thus maintain the status of being a ""Jewish"" state. But there's no way to ensure that demographic makeup without actively maintaining it through subjugation.

I think morally we shouldn't be opposed to a majority Jewish society; the issue is when the majority Jewish society decides that it has a *right* to be a majority Jewish society, which is what ethnostates do.

Israel doesn't have the moral right in my mind to actively preserve its identity, because it requires subjugation. This is why Zionism is dangerous in my mind because it promotes the idea of an ethnostate having the God-given *right* to maintain a Jewish identity.",2023-11-18 19:34:39

Its like having a warrior leader to find and fight for a place to settle in. Then when that is done, the warrior leader steps down to give way to a peace time leader for stability and prosperity.

Israel's Basic Law states that Israel is an exclusive state for the jewish people (see article 1.C of the Nation Bill / Basic Law). How would a non-Jewish Israeli have equal rights when self-determination based on equal rights and obligations is exclusive to an ethnic group and not the other. This is not to say that Arab Israeli citizens for instance do not enjoy a degree of citizenship rights *relative to* other Middle Eastern states. But this is beside the point. Arabs are not conscripted in Israeli military, but service of Jewish citizens is mandatory. This says something about how the state views one group of people versus another. Clearly Arabs do not enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as the Jewish citizens do. 

We can follow this thread to Zionism as political ideology. How non-Jewish people in Israel can have equal rights when Zionism is an ethno–nationalist project  that aims to establish a nation-state that is unique to the Jewish people. This is complicated with the fact that in historical Palestine there existed diverse groups of religions that existed prior to the establishment of Israel. 

Therefore it's a bigger issue of just one Israeli government or the other. It's an inherent paradox in the Zionist ideology. Of course there are different variations and different people look at it differently, but the basic principle remains true that establishing , this indeed was always true in the case of all states across the world – America, Australia, South Africa etc.. If you claim a piece of land belongs to a specific group of people based on ethnicity, religion or any other social aspect, you are automatically marginalise those who fall out of these descriptions.",2023-11-18 01:58:05

1. The Nakba: Like it or not the genesis of the Jewish state included mass murder and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

So characterizing the problem with settlements as “A few crazy settlers” is underselling that settlement and expansion is fundamental to Zionism.

Let's make something really clear, Zionists are not special, every group in human history has struggled with multiculturalism, with suspicion of the other, and whatever way you slice it, people of one culture, ethnicity and race tend to feel superior in greater numbers than others, often being very vocal when they are. Zionism is no different to conservatives in every single country that just want to preserve their own traditions and are fearful of outside influence or integration. That is not uniquely human social grouping, it's common throughout the animal kingdom. It's just not very civilised, and evil actors are not very civilised and galvanise this xenophobic fear. 

I don't care if Israel exists as a state, or if palestine exists as a state, I wish the world could exist if there were no borders and no states, but human beings are just jumped up animals with the same basic fears and impulses.

I don't mean this to be an attack. We all hold biases whether we do so willingly or not - but the mere fact you recognize a potential atrocity happening to Israelis while failing to recognize the current atrocity happening to Palestinians is a clear-cut example of your pro-Israel/ anti-Arab bias. 

If you find it easy to justify the killing of Palestinian civilians, including thousands of children, no less, because the offensive is being done in response to a previous atrocity carried out on Oct. 7th, you are also showing a bias. This bias leads one to ignore any and all events which took place before Oct. 7th, as though on that day, a bunch of men attacked Israeli citizens ""just because.""

Those events - which ought to be condemned - did not happen in a vacuum. Much like Israel feels justified in killing Palestinian children in response to Oct. 7th, Hamas feels justified in killing civilians in response 75 years of a brutal, one-sided settler-colonialist project which forcefully removed 700,000 people from their homes in order to make way for millions of Forgien people to come in and erect a Jewish state. And they did so through terrorism.

I can already anticipate the weak counter-argument that I'm showing my bias by using terms like ""settler-colonialism"" and ""terrorism"" when describing the violent settler movement which was necessary to make way for a Jewish state. I purposefully used these words, because they were the words used by the settlers themselves to describe what they were doing. If you would like to read a brief account of the [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba) from the Arab perspective, I highly recommend reading [Jewish Atrocities in the Holy Land](https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/pdf/palestine4/Jewish-Atrocities-in-the-Holy-Land.pdf) which was published by the League of Arab States in 1948 and retained by the US Library of Congress. An excerpt from the document: (the following quote was recorded by a reliable British journalist while speaking with a Zionist) ""When we massacre, we shall not only kill the men; we shall massacre the women and children, and then their cows, sheep, and Oxen.""

There's a reason Palestinians and the Arab world refer to the events of 1948 as the ""Nakba;"" it translates to ""The catastrophe."" And that's exactly what it was. Children were ripped from their parent's arms and thrown into wood-fired ovens before they too were murdered.

People don't seem to understand - Hamas WANTS Israel to kill the civilians. They want the martyrdom, as it's the only way they can beat Israel. They aren't able to out-gun them, so they try and cause outside intervention.

Israel wants to be considered its own sovereign state and for Palestine to not use violence/attack them. That's all they have to do. This has been offered many times over the last few decades.

And yet, Palestinians decline every time. I wonder why? They claim the land is theirs because of a holy book, yet there is evidence of Jews being there (and always being there) as well as evidence that the Arabian people in the past there were more nomads, so which ""land"" is theirs exactly? It's based on a religious scripture with some vague notions of what is there.

Israel is fine with freedom of religion. Hamas is not. Israel has some form of democracy. Hamas does not. Do I really have to keep going? Israel has some semblance of human rights. Hamas does not, unless you consider Sharia Law something to be a good basis for equality.

It's pretty clear which side are the ""bad guys"". Hamas sets up in civilian areas, including hospitals. It's like when the US was in Iraq/Afghanistan. Guerrilla warfare. It will likely take years and years to fully flush them out because they hide in plain sight and use civilians as cover.

So after reading this, would Hamas bomb its own hospital? Probably. Did they? Who knows. Was it Israel? Maybe, and that's not okay. No doubt they do some terrible/shady things.

You can also see it in the videos - hundreds of Palestinians who are not in Hamas military uniform or armed.  I'm sorry to say, but I no longer feel sorry for the ""innocent"" Palestinians.  Hamas members admitted that they let their children hold weapons and practice killing Jews.  Of course I still want peace but I no longer regret losses during the war on the Palestinian side.

Arab not standing with Israel

What logic is for Hamas to kill their own country people
The only logic is to show how isarel is war crime and bomping hospital

And there is big difference between country and group
War crime country
That already killed children and citizen before bomp hospital and not only this days but for 75 years

But on the other side
Israel doesnt care to bomp hospital bec they did it before and already alarmed they will bomp hospital 2 days ago

The perpetrators likely went under the top Hamas brass - which explains how they got the jump on Israel's intelligence agencies. The leadership can not condemn their own fighters but also need to stop the conflict. 

Israel will (and should) continue the fight until Hamas is eradicated. Even if Hamas leadership is not to blame for this attack, they obviously can not control their forces.

Israel says no, 'think of the hostages.' Iran, Syria, Hez, West Bank all get involved. US has to get involved. Russia, maybe China have incredible propaganda against Israel and the US. Egypt, who has been sending aid, grows hostile. 

Israel agrees to ceasefire in furtherance of a truce. Just a cease fire allows the scum to regroup, move hostages, receive arms and supplies.

Pinkwashing portrays a democratic, liberal and gay-friendly image of Israel, supported by its relatively gay-friendly laws. As a counterpoint to this idyllic picture of Israel, the pinkwashing campaign also aims to paint a racist and false image of the monolithically homophobic, backward and barbaric Arab/Palestinian.

I guess this dumb flyaway post listing your assumptions on what all Gazans believe about various Western culture war bullshit is your rationalisation of the carpet bombing of 2 million people. 

Try to understand this.

I, and many others, think your view on this particular matter is abhorrent and genocidal.

But I, and hopefully the majority of those other people, would **never** condone your death because you hold a view we find appalling (which you may change in the years to come and which in part may your way of coping with witnessing atrocity after atrocity in real-time). 

And I would **never, ever, ever** attribute that particular view to your family, your community or the city or country you live in, and in doing so condone their destruction and displacement as it happens in real time.

Your life is still sacred in my eyes, because you are a human being, even if I hate your views.

While Palestinians are justified to be outraged that someone came to their land and displaced them (even if it was with the agreement of a part of the international community), I cannot believe that they don’t see Hamas as their main threat.

There is this story in my culture: a hardworking person would make a paradise out of a shack and an irresponsible person would ruin a palace.

So while Palestinians have been wronged and are wronged, they don’t seem to help themselves in the slightest.

I would be more on board with “free palestine” if I saw the pre-war Gaza as a functioning, flourishing society who is trying to get their land back. Instead, what they appear like is a dysfunctional failed society looking to blame outside sources while not doing anything for its own good. 

So, let’s say hypothetically that the impossible happens and Israeli people leave and the land is given to Palestinians. Are they all of a sudden going to have an amazing country, with good infrastructure, education, rational leaders, etc? No! Most likely they’ll just extend their mess on a larger geographical area.

From the river to the sea refers to the Jordan river which is the eastern border of Israel and the Mediterranean sea which is the western border of Israel, again the entire land of Israel.

That's exactly the source of the conflict and why it could never be solved, Israel is willing to share and split the land and the Palestinians want it all, they have been teaching their children for generations that one day they will get all the land and even if one day their leadership strikes a deal for only part of the land the people just won't accept it.",2023-10-22 20:18:10

As westerners,  it's easy for us to say ""Free Palestine"", but if you look at history,  it would appear Palestine doesn't want to be Free.

To sum up your second paragraph,  Multiculturalism is a lie.  Also,  all of the Hamas leaders are wealthy.  They live it up in Qatar, while the people they subjugate live in poverty.  We *should* be asking for them to be turned over.  But we aren't. 

If Hamas is not bloodied beyond recognition,  there will be consequences.   Hezbollah is watching from the north.  With Lebanon and Syria as allies, and with ties to Iran,  Russia,  and China,  Israel has no choice but to seek Hamas blood.  And with good cause!  If Hamas comes out of this unscathed,  it would be as if Israel had shown its neck to all of its rivals,  which would be the case. 

Israel IS respecting the Palestinians lives.  They're trying so hard to avoid civilian casualties; from sending sms text,  to calling,  to dropping 'roof knockers', small ordinance designed to ""rattle cages"", and send everyone packing.  Hamas isn't allowing that,  instead setting up roadblocks zero and urging everyone to ignore Israel's warnings   which are numerous.

The other tribe at the center of this conflict has focused more historically on shoring up its internal strength, resilience, and backup resources, as opposed to assimilating other tribes or forging strategic alliances with outside tribes. They often feel, to some extent correctly, that no one else is on their side. Because they haven’t invested heavily in getting other tribes on their side.

""Free Palestine,"" in the context of Hamas, means destroying Israel and replacing it with a Salafist Islamic theocracy. Hamas's charter (dating back to 1987!) explicitly states that it will never accept a two-state solution. By contrast, Israel's official stance is that it wants a two-state solution. People may accuse Israel of \*secretly\* opposing a peaceful, two-state solution... but we must all admit that Hamas \*openly\* opposes a peaceful, two-state solution. \[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas\\\_Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Charter)\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas\_Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Charter))

It only takes a few minutes to read this charter. Please just do it. Hamas, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, says it wants to violently conquer the entire land... and make Islam the only acceptable religion. Which is exactly what they have been been attempting to do,  up to \*and including\* these recent terror attacks.  When people say ""Free Palestine"" they are unwittingly supporting the above goals of Hamas... NOT the goals that they actually have in mind.

I am saying all of this as a left-leaning member of the LGBT community. I am also saying this as an atheist and anti-theist who is utterly fed up with the ""Abrahamic"" religions. These are simply the facts as best as I can tell. All emotion aside.",2023-10-22 20:15:23

Obama predicted years ago that Israel’s aggressive action of killing innocent Palestinian civilians and allowing over half a million Israelis move to the West Bank and kick the Palestinians out of their homes, often violently, would lead to this moment. And guess what? It did. So many want to talk about Israel being allowed to protect itself,  now what about Palestinians? Do we agree they are allowed to protect themselves?

Israel was founded by European colonists. I don't know why we should fault the Arab countries for wanting to stop the creation of Israel. At the time, it was the morally right thing to do. The USA should have helped the Arab countries stop the creation of Israel. It would've been strategically beneficial to the US in the long run. As an American, I'm tired of America's constant entanglement in Israel's affairs. Why does America have to keep defending this deeply unpopular country? 

 9/11 would not have happened, thousands of Americans' lives would have been saved, and hundreds of billions of dollars would've been saved, if America stayed 100% outside of the conflict since 1948.

When the Arabs wanted to defeat the Ottoman Empire, since it was a bunch of foreigners controlling the area, the whole world was supporting the Arabs.

If Zionism had never existed and the British Empire ruled over the area, the whole world would've cheered on the Arabs if they fought against the British Empire.

3231,"People make decisions largely on emotion and not facts. They then seek facts that validate their position. They consider themselves intellectual but they are anything but.

Most of the arguments I see in support of Palestine are based around emotion and not fact. People feel empathy because they consider the Palestinians the weaker opponent and so must be the innocent party. Now I am now suggesting that the outcomes are not wholly disproportionate, but most arguments never seem to mention who the aggressor was.  We are seeing this playing out right now. If you go up to the biggest kid in the playground and poke him in the eye, expect to get you ass kicked badly.

I am sympathetic to the Palestinians but I mainly support the Israeli perspective. The arguments I don't agree with are:

Colonization- this argument is used constantly and I don't agree with it. The British took control of the region after WW1, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in a war that they started. I have no idea how this constitutes colonization and if you do then you are denying the existence of nearly every country on the planet. And back then there was no law against it, in fact The right of conquest was recognized under international law.  The fact that the Allies did not start the conflict only supports this claim further. Territorial gain as compensation for the cost and the lives lost in a war that you did not start.

Apartheid: Another term very loosely thrown around the pro Palestine fraternity. All Arabs are allowed to live and work in Israel, they can run in the parliament if they wanted to and can own property. Israelis are not allowed to own property in the Palestinian controlled areas and have no rights. If Hamas and the PLO had more power they would absolutely instigate an apartheid structure against Israelis or even worse ethnically cleanse them completely. This is a stated goal of Hamas in their charter.

All the other wars: Lets not forget that the Arab nations have started every war against Israel with the sole purpose of wiping them off that land. The fact they have been shockingly unsuccessful  at it does not take away the fact they are the aggressors- every single time. And when the consequences of that action result in restriction of movement, walls, territorial loss, they do nothing but complain. Decisions have consequences and often they can be catastrophic.

The Peace Process: When the UN recommended the partition plan in 1947- with a 55/45 split- given that Israel was getting the south with was mainly desert, Israel accepted it. The Arabs did not, not because they did not think the split was inequitable, because they would never accept even 1% of the land going to Israel. Fast forward 5 attempts at a 2 state solution and Arabs have rejected every time and Israel has accepted every time.

While I feel for the Palestinians- they voted in Hamas- it has been a terrible decision for them and combined with the decades of other poor decisions is largely  the reason they are in their current position. Until they get over this preoccupation with taking all the land back, accept that Israel is not going anywhere, then I am confident that peace can be achieved.",2023-11-16 02:15:12

3261,"Palestine and Israel conflict is a no brainer. 

Lemme present you a few facts,

The majority of pro-Palestine supporters may be influenced by their native media agencies. I use the term 'brainwashed' because:

* Many of these countries lack a proper democracy. So you can guess their press freedom ranking pretty well.
* The populace is often misinformed; some may not even be aware that there was no Palestinian state initially.
* Media channels in these regions hide historical facts, such as the events of Black September. Many 'pro-Hamas supporters' may not even know that Egypt sought control over the Gaza Strip, or that Jordan held the West Bank for several years.
* Accusations that 'Israel is a terrorist state' are made by individuals residing in countries like Pakistan, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Yemen—nations known for producing terrorists through their stupid madarsas(so-called educational institutions).
* Many supporters fail to grasp that Israel would benefit from a peace agreement with Palestine (Gaza). Numerous peace treaties proposed by the US, UN, and Israel have been rejected by Arab countries.
* A significant portion of these supporters oppose the existence of Israel, making arguments with them futile.",2023-11-16 08:37:40

I don’t argue with people but I will respond with bits of history and their sources.

Because those are unfortunately blanket statements that can quickly be rebutted with ground evidence. Not everyone is misguided by social media. Your arguments are official truths but they are unsupported by ground truths. 

For instance - Officially, there was unilateral disengagement process from the Gaza Strip in 2005. The ground truth is that Israel still has control over the transportation infrastructure, airspace and maritime boundaries of the Gaza Strip as well as the supplies electricity and water. 

To counter argue what I just told you, you could easily pull up evidence of Palestinians enjoying free movement throughout Gaza with access to the aforementioned items. 

If Israel is no longer in Gaza, according to the official truth, then these statistics would be untrue:  https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/fact-sheet-movement-and-access-west-bank-august-2023

I assume then, that you would tell me that these reports are untrue and biased. Which would proceed with your argument falling into the argumentum ad lapidem fallacy. 

“Palestine was never an independent state” is a fallacious appeal to authority. Regardless of how “officiql” statehood was, those are human beings who descended from that land and have lived on that land before settlement. 

If you truly believe your position, have evidence on hand. Not statements, but ground truths.

3340,"Yes, justifying what increasingly appears to be a genocide would be draining. And it seems like there might be some bias in how you approach these discussions. It can be exhausting repeating the same memorized points without honestly listening to understand different perspectives. It is equally exhausting to me to see the same talking points parroted by so many. 

You say that Israel left Gaza in 2005, but it's not quite as straightforward as you make it sound. Israel still imposes severe restrictions on movement and trade, and military activities are frequent and ongoing. That doesn't seem to fit the narrative of having completely ""left."" Many serious human rights organizations still classify Gaza as occupied for this reason. (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/gaza-israel-occupied-international-law/)

As for the casualty difference between Israelis and Palestinians, I’d say it is largely because Hamas isn't a fully-equipped military force, unlike Israel, which has one of the most advanced militaries and powerful allies. Israel is not notoriously precise in their operations, with the vast majority of the 11,000+ dead being civilians or children. And I know folks will say “human shields”, “advance warnings” etc… yes, I know the memorized arguments. Yet still, 1 out of every 200 people have died in Gaza. This is a tragedy. 

I do agree with you there is a lot of misinformation and many people are misinformed. The media, propaganda, and rhetoric aren’t helping. that makes it even more important that we all do our due diligence. If it's really a complex situation like many Israel supporters say, shouldn't we all approach it with more humility and willingness to learn from those we disagree with?

If you are feeling exhausted, consider advocating for a Ceasefire – an end to all hostilities on ALL sides, and the release of all hostages, including those captured in Israel on 10/7 AND the thousands held in the West Bank without charge.

Lead with your heart. It's less draining than endless debates. If you find yourself needing to dehumanize or criminalize people to defend a government's actions, it's a red flag that there is likely oppression going on. The reality is, none of these governments have our best interests at heart and we SHOULD hold them accountable. Nobody is safer today as a result of Israel’s actions. 

I'm sincerely not trying to stir up anger, just aiming for an honest conversation. I’m hoping that ALL HUMANS can find peace, safety, and security.

The people who haven't been following with get bored eventually and they will move on the their next cause. 

Another important thing right now is to stand up to the antisemitism within the anti-zionist cause. When they call it white colonialism it's important to be loud and clear that they can't erase the identity of the majority of Israli jews by pointing them as white, it's important to point out the double standard of calling it colonialism when it wouldn't fit the standard definition of colonialism, and it's important to note that any other group of refugees would be seen as having rights to self determination so Jews should be no different.

Israel only came into being in 1948 after they ethnically cleansed 80% of the population. While many claim this was after the war. It actually started months before and the war was a direct result.

3368,"Most states support a ""2 State"" solution

Most states do NOT support what Israel is doing now, and what it has been doing over last 25 years.


The ""2-State"" solution is basically the Oslo I/II agreements - made in 1993-1995.

Both parties agreed to Oslo.

Photos of them shaking hands on it was global news for like weeks.

Everyone was full of hope that they are on a path to calming everything down long term.

But Israel did not honor that deal. Israel made no progress in transferring Area C in the 5 years that it had to do so. Instead, as the deadline drew near, it started pouring ~200,000 settlers into Area C in 1997-2000

When it became obvious Israel is not going to honor Oslo, Clinton tried to rescue it and set up Wye River as the last ditch attempt to at least have Israel start that process and give some... any... of Area C just to keep the hope going. And afterwards Israel reneged to those tiny transfer as well...

All these settlers arriving into Area C is what started off the Second Intifada (2 years after the 5 year deadline that was in the Oslo agreements)

Now 500,000 Jewish settlers are in Area C, and 6 months ago Israeli government ministries were instructed to make plans to move another 500,000 settlers into Area C...

The steady stream of news of injustices in Area C over last 25 years is the reason why so many people worldwide are now waving Palestinian flags instead of Israeli flags.

------------------

Oslo agreement was that a Palestinian Authority (PA) would be established and assume governing responsibilities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period. Israel army was to be allowed access only to guard against external threats (ie: Jordan)

* ""Israel left Gaza in 2005"" -> Fact. However, there were **MANY** incidents where the IDF treated the Palestinian people harshly. Several abuses of human rights. Even detaining [children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzvKSn9nKJo) of the age of 5. Or perhaps [storming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxtDmdhjNFA) one of the holiest places in Islam and brutally beating protestors. The IDF has an entire history filled with abuses to the Palestinian people. **Violence breeds violence.**
* ""Less Israelis die because Israel actually defends their citizens"" -> Fact. Israel has the right to defend its citizens. But Israel should also know that violence breeds violence. Lack of accountability and the treatment of others as ""inferior"" will breed violence. Whether It's in Israel or South Africa.
* ""Palestine was never an independent state before 1948"" -> I'm not sure what you mean by that. Palestine was not an independent state before 1948. That's a fact. But It wasn't ""land without people"". There were people there. If you're informed, you will know that Jews migrated to land WITH people. And decided to create a state on land that were owned by people. The Zionist dream was actually fulfilled by several Anti-Semitic men in Europe that wanted to get rid of the Jews living there. You acknowledge that and we have no problem.

I'm not sure who you're referring to as the ""uninformed people"". I'm an Arab, I'm Pro-palestine. I'm against Hamas's actions in Oct 7th. But I'm also against the IDF's brutal actions for the weeks to follow. You can wipe out Hamas for all I care, but you shouldn't be able to murder thousands of children in the process and get away with it. If this happened to a European country we'd have WWIII.

Also less israeli's die both because the IDF actually defends them, and because they're one of the most technologically advanced militaries in the world thanks soley to the United States.

If the Gazan's also had an iron dome, you wouldn't be seeing 100+ civilians dying on a daily basis

On the flip side, only 34 israeli's have been killed since the initial attack on October 7th 

Also ""palestine never being an official nation before 1948"" is sorta irrelevant.

3383,"""Israel left Gaza is in 2005"" is a lie and you know it. Israel started neglecting Gaza in 2005 and let Hamas run its day to day affairs like thugs. But Israel controls Gaza's air space, sea, land borders (including Rafah, jointly with Egypt), water, electricity, fuel supply, food supply and literally any other activity there. Israel controls what gets into Gaza and what gets out. Gaza is an open air Israeli prison and a Palestinian ghetto. Therefore, as an occupier, Israel has no right to self defense against an occupied territory. For example, the US couldn't bomb Puerto Rico even if it were overrun by gangs and terrorists. It can take action against the gangs, but the US has responsibility towards civilians in Puerto Rico. Similarly, Israel has a responsibility towards Gaza. 

""Palestine was not an independent state before 1948"". Correct, Palestine was a British colony but Palestinian people lived there before 1948. In 1948 many Palestinians were slaughtered and expelled from their homes in what is now Israel and these people have a right to go back to their homeland, even if it wasn't a state. 

""Less Israelis die because Israel actually defends their citizens"". Partially true. Another important thing to add is that Gaza does not have any military or the firepower to attack main land Israel. Israel has sophisticated bombs to carpet bomb Gaza which is what they've been doing. Hamas is a bunch of terrorists who have some firearms and rockets but it's nowhere near what Israel has. But apparently Israel's superior military power is proving to be useless. They've killed 11,000 civilians mostly women and children. How many Hamas terrorists have they killed to show for it?

And then suddenly, on the anniversary of the Yom Kippur war, it’s breached at 6 different entry points, allowing gunman on the backs of pickup trucks to enter the border towns and festival area, attacking for 8 straight hours, completely unscathed and unopposed, giving them enough time to kill all those people and take hostages back to Gaza. 

You honestly have to be an idiot to not see what’s going on here. We know that Netanyahu was being investigated for corruption charges by the left wing Supreme Court, and he was trying to rewrite the rules to make sure they couldn’t remove him for those charges. The country was also bitterly divided, and many secular Jews from the millennial and Gen z generations didn’t care for him, so his approval rating was declining massively. 

So what could a prime minister do to retain his role when his career is in jeopardy? Allow an attack, use the gruesome footage to broadcast to the entire country and world, and unify his people in order to wage war against Hamas. Then he would emerge as the courageous leader who responded to the attacks and led his people to victory by defeating Hamas. 

This was about self preservation for Netanyahu and his haredi parliament, and at his core, he doesn’t give a damn about the Jewish people, and he certainly doesn’t give a damn about the 11,000 Palestinian civilians that died from the more than 7,000 rockets launched on Gaza, all while knowing that most of the Hamas militants were hiding underground in tunnel networks with the hostages. 

This man committed treason against his own people and is now engaging in an ethic cleansing of Gaza. He’s a psychopath of the greatest magnitude and a danger to humanity.

As for the state argument I will answer with this:

""The right to self-defence - as recognized by Article 51 of the Charter - is a right attributable to ""States"" only in their ""international"" relations. A State is allowed to recourse to self-defence if it is subject to another State's unlawful use of force.""

Is gaza a state, is Palestine a state? Why isn't Gaza a state if"" israel withdrew""? And if it's not a state, how can israel launch a war on a non-state, or more accurately a territory it effectively controls.

3417,"Israel is an invading and occupying nation. You would be in the same situation if you decided to relocate Israel to Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, or Jordan after WWII, with a large influx of immigrants. 

Any country that is forced to accept mass immigration, particularly in the Middle East, is likely to react negatively as the Palestinians did from day one. 

It is a weak argument to claim that Palestine was never independent. Lebanon had no independence, Saudi Arabia had no independence, and the entire region was ruled by the Ottomans. However, the ottomans assigned administrative leaders to each distinct. Raising the status of various minority groups. It maintained the centuries-old regional names that had been in use; in fact, the so-called insulting name for Palestine had been in use for nearly two millennia. The name is clearly embraced by the locals. The British even acknowledged Palestine as such, there were coins dubbed British Palestine and passports etc of British palestine origin. 

With your definition of an independent country, I suppose England had the right to invade Australia because it was not independent. Killing and murdering all the locals.. Or the invasion of America and its non independent country. 

It is disturbing how you use this to support Israel's ongoing expansion and even the creation of Israel .

Australia for example has been able to recognise the aboriginal people as the original occupiers of the land and they were not even regarded as a civilisation, they were able to prove boundaries using rock monuments and trees. 

Palestinians are constantly being told by Israel that their presence was meaningless. They are getting kicked out of homes they lived in cause they couldn’t provide a title or admin papers and being told the buildings are defective under Israel law and subsequently find their houses being demolished and rebuilt and occupied by Israelis. ? 

How you use this to justify constant expansion practices in Israel is unsettling. 

“Israel's defense of its citizens, while valid, overlooks the constraints faced by Palestinians in Gaza. Lacking an airport, ocean access, and freedom to trade or mine, they remain under Israeli administrative control since 1967, leading to an Orwellian reality.. 

Israel couldn’t integrate  the Palestinians into  the country because it was their country to begin with. . It’s like invading someone’s home and acting shocked that they didn’t want to share the house with you.",2023-11-16 09:24:36

How did you expect them to react when Israeli government doesn’t allow them a reelection?

How did you expect them to react when they protested against Israel's land, air and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2018-2019, without weapons, only to get shot and gassed by IDF?

How can one *not* be hopeless about the prospects of a solution when you have two bullheaded, hyper-traumatized, stupid populations, who think they’re equally entitled to this tiny territory, where each labels the other as “animals,” and both use the crimes and atrocities of the other as a pretext for committing crimes and atrocities themselves?",2023-10-14 20:43:56

3481,"We have heard your voice - now I would urge you to hear this: 

Imagine being FORCED out of your home where your family lived for generations, where people of all religions lived in peace since the birth of civilization. That was the case for Palestine 75 years ago. 

Imagine that every year since - your neighbourhoods are levelled to the ground and your country is chipped away from you in plain sight. Your family is forced into smaller and smaller territories with limited access to food, water and the freedom of movement. At this point, everyday life across Palestine exists at the mercy of Israel.

Imagine as you look over the hill where your family once lived - all you see is thriving settlements, music festivals, and parties - while your family is struggling to find the basic means necessary to survive. 

Imagine being a mother - unable to feed, nourish or educate her child - only to find her murdered toddler right outside her home. Imagine this not being the first child to be killed within the community - but a reality for hundreds of children and families slaughtered at the hands of the IDF. Children are not being taught to hate - they have grown up losing cousins, siblings, parents and friends in front of their eyes. 

Yes - 1,400 Israelis have been killed since the war broke out - including hundreds of innocent people. But at LEAST 2,500 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands throughout the years. And the worse is yet to come - the number is expected to SKYROCKET as Israel begins its ruthless barrage into Gaza. This is only the beginning - you hear them say.

Israel warned 1.1 MILLION people to evacuate to the southern part of the Gaza Strip within 24 hours. Imagine having to carry your life in a bag and your children in your hands, to an already forcibly TINY territory where there is no water, food or fuel - let alone any infrastructure to support this once-again displaced population.

Israel opened 2 so-called “safe routes” to allow Palestinians to flee south. Imagine that while on this “safe” route - an Israeli airstrike hits, killing a number of women and children desperately trying to flee.

Imagine being in the ICU because of your injuries, within a hospital that has over 2,000 patients - including newborn babies, as well as the critically injured and dying. Now you receive a notice that you have to move, or else your death is just a matter of time. What do you do - as a doctor, patient or parent?

Imagine not having ANY international government who is willing to support your people, acknowledge both sides, or open their borders to take you in. Everywhere you look, governments are pouring their support to Israel - while turning a blind eye to the inevitable reality that has faced, and will face, millions of Palestinians over the next few days. 

Let me be clear - I am not here to claim that what Hamas has done is justified - or that the situation is not absolute HELL for everyone who has to live through every brutal minute of it. But to look at it only from one side, or as an isolated event, is simply wrong. This was not an isolated event.

As for the familial anger your family is expecting loyalty from you not neutrality.  Your side has decided to go to war with Hamas to destroy Hamas (or at least Hamas in Gaza).

Not the Netanyahu government, Jews as a whole, including your family. 

When the USA clearing Fascism out of Japan that required killing a lot of people. When the Iranians (Hamas' patron) decided to fight Al Qaeda affiliates in Syria they ended up driving 1/2 the Syrian population out.   War is very bloody and brutal.  When the Gazans choose to support Hamas what is about to happen is one of the risks.

At the same time, a lot of younger American Jews genuinely have a very flawed understanding of the conflict, and that can turn into a sort of ""both-sides-ism"" that's very frustrating for the folks you encounter that disagree with you, even if they're willing to acknowledge the faults that their side has had, and their shared humanity with ""the other side"".

Framing the conflict as, ""both sides are equally wrong,"" is unlikely to be true, and *is* guaranteed to upset whoever you're talking to, regardless of which ""side"" they are on. It's also not really accurate.

e.g., take a single phrase you used as an example: ""the siege of Gaza"". 

The Great Wall of China wasn't built to ""besiege"" the Eurasian steppe; it was a defensive fortification. Similarly, Gaza has not been ""under siege""; the two countries it borders have closed their borders and territorial waters to it. As with all militarized borders, that was in *response* to continued aggression (from Gaza, into Egypt and into Israel). Both countries experienced dozens of bombings and terrorist attacks a year ... so they shut down their borders, and did their best to not allow armaments to get through to the other side, knowing that the armaments would be used *against them.* 

The 'siege' framing implies that Israel and Egypt are doing this in order to force Gaza into submission; it's literally Hamas's framing of the situation, because when people think of ""siege"", they think of starving a garrison until they surrender. Israel doesn't *want* Gaza to surrender. It doesn't *want* to occupy Gaza; it already occupied it for 38 years, and it *left.* It just wants Gaza to *stop attacking Israel.* The agency is with Hamas; Israel can't do anything to end the situation, but Hamas can. 

So ... it's not a siege.",2023-10-11 12:02:09

The answer is equal rights and protection under the law for ALL in the region. That is always the answer in conflict. Hanging on to religious fairy tales, or to the admittedly justified anger and pain, to continue with senseless violence, will only prolong the suffering of all involved.

Now with that in mind, and being all of those things, tell me how you would feel in the following hypothetical scenario:  Suppose one week the media was saturated with images of multiple police shootings of unarmed black Americans, and then there was rioting and a deep collective rage and sadness among black Americans combined with a new, overdue beginning of awareness for many other Americans of what black Americans experience when their lives are treated as less valuable than others. And suppose there was a mantra associated with this burgeoning movement that acknowledged the simple and overdie truth that Black Lives Matter.  Suppose also that some of the riots turned violent at times, some opportunistic looting and vandalism occurred, and worst of all, some acts of direct violence including murder targeting individual police occurred. Now imagine you were in a room of black Americans during this tumultuous time of emotions running high and a revolution in racial conversation in this country, and someone with a love of all humanity just like yours  said, right in front of you ""I know this shouldn't be controversial so I'm just going to say it. ALL LIVES MATTER. Systemic racism in the policing of black communities and individuals must be condemned, and so must acts of violence by black men against police. Both are wrong and one dossnt take away from the other, because ALL LIVES MATTER.""


How would you feel about that person in that moment? Would you say he failed to read the room?

People scoffed at this notion before as Israel was actually the one on the defense hunkering down behind fences and the Iron Dome, while the entire time Hamas was extremely efficient at importing significant weaponry, ammunition and training in order to inflict mass casualties on Israel.  

It's now entirely clear that once Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, the die was cast.  Sadly, Israel waited too long and allowed the entire institutional capture of an area the size of Philadelphia with over 2 million people to become a forward operation base for Iranian ambitions in the region.

1. Evacuate all Gazan civilians into refugee camps in southern Israel. If the goal is truly to end Hamas, spare as many civilians as possible from the bloodshed. As long as civilians die, more Gazans will be radicalized and there will not be peace.
2. Apprehend, by any means necessary, all Hamas fighters in Gaza

Once this is completed there is no possibility of return to the status quo and we must begin the process of finally ensuring equal rights of all Palestinians as Israeli citizens.

Almost all of them have called for peace and acknowledged the sad loss of life and suffering that Palestinians experience as well - both in person and on social media. The vast majority of Jewish people DO NOT WANT WAR. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron. Jewish people have suffered at the hands of subsequent governments and empires for generations. The city I was born in was the site of a massacre of Jewish children where the Nazi army lined up dozens of Jewish children and shot them 1 by 1 into a mass grave because they were CRYING TOO LOUD. On account of all their parents already having been shot dead and them being left starving and cold in a building. That same town that once had a bustling Jewish population of over 50% today has less than 0.1%

Israel in many respects has become the final stand for Jewish people. It’s where people fled to and said enough is enough. We deserve dignity and safety too. Out of that they’ve built one of the most beautiful and thriving countries in the world and it’s the only state the Jewish people have. Literally the only one. 

All throughout its existence, it’s Israel extending the olive branch asking its Arab neighbours to recognise its existence, accept it and let them live in peace. Every time it has been Israel and the Jewish people offering compromises to come to a solution. And every time their hand has been slapped away and been rewarded with war and terrorism instead.

So to answer your question. Are you weird for considering and mourning Palestinian lives? No you’re not, this is a normal Jewish response as all life is sacred and we all know war begets war.

I was born after 9/11 but in the 2010s (when I first was old enough to begin to understand politics), a lot of people still had that attitude that if you criticized the USA’s actions in other countries it meant you hated America and wanted terrorism to happen again or some dumb stuff. Even now I’ve noticed if you criticize the USA in general (such as kneeling for the flag instead of standing for it in protest of something), people will claim that you’re disrespecting the soldiers who died fighting for the US. I feel like that’s how both people who are pro-no-matter-what Israel and pro-no-matter-what Palestine react if you criticize their side. They’ll say: “So you think ____ deserved that” or “what about when _____ do it to us” or “There’s clearly one right side and if you’re silent we notice”.

With the settlers never moving out and more influx of Jews into Gaza and West Bank there was never a chance of Palestinians feeling legitimized if the Israelites still live in their territory that was sanctioned to them by UN agreements.

It’s about standing for Israel’s right to defend itself against a full scale terrorist attack that’s goal is to wipe not only Jewish people off the land but anyone that isn’t Hamas. It’s not about Palestine for Hamas and it’s not about the people. This is not the Israel Palestine conflict. This is terrorism and it has to be looked at that way. Believe that Hamas would gladly kill the Palestinians if they don’t stand with them. They are not the people they represent and they must be removed. I wish there was more that had been done for the civilians of the strip before Israel counter attacked but at the same time they have hostages, they were continuing attacks, more terrorist agencies are getting involved. This is not about Palestine or the right/left political stances and issues. This is terrorism and defending terrorism in the name of liberation is just plain gross imo.

They sacrificed over 100 Palestinian children for the tunnel construction. Regrettably, the residents of Gaza fell under Hamas's influence, undergoing a form of brainwashing, and through history have consistently rebuffed Israel's efforts to cooperate. Israel did all it could, even closing borders to prevent violence spilling over. Substantial funds were sent to aid the Gaza Strip's people. Yet, Hamas seized these resources, including water pipes, converting them into rockets. These funds failed to enhance their living conditions, infrastructure, or education; instead, they enriched Hamas leaders. If Palestinians were to establish their own government and become self-reliant, Hamas would lose its financial incentives so Hamas has no motivation to improve their lives. The true victims in this situation are the women and young children, as their men, who are meant to protect them, too often permit them to suffer as casualties of war.

3715,"I am also a Jew and I understand why you feel this way. There is nothing wrong about you feeling sorry for the innocent Palestinians getting hurt in the crossfire I have sympathy for them too. However, there is no moral equivalence in this fight. If Israel laid their weapons down for 1 minute there would be no Israel left. The Palestinians in Gaza under Hamas leadership have rejected over 5 different piece agreements over the years that would have dramatically improved the life of the Palestinians. 

Most people forget that Israel removed thousands of their own citizens in 2005 and gave it to the Palestinians as a gesture of piece to live and create opportunity for themselves.

The international community has poured in billions of dollars in foreign aid over the years and what did they do with those funds? They didn’t invest it in building up Gaza to help their people rather to purchase weapons, rockets, bombs, tunnels, to launch attacks against Israel. Hamas has held power in Gaza for 16 years and what did they do with that power? The lives of the Palestinians have only gotten worse and less safe because  their primary goal is not to improve Palestinian lives in the region but to destroy Israel. 

There are over 1.6 million Palestinians that live under Israeli territory. They walk around freely, have rights can participate in the economy etc.. I’m pretty sure they would not trade places to be governed by Hamas. 

The unfortunate reality is that it is Hamas that has no regard for the Palestinians hiding behind them placing weapons in schools, mosques, In civilian populations hiding behind their own people like cowards while they bring upon this hell and destruction on gaza but then cry’s victim to gain sympathy from the world. it is Hamas to blame for the pain and suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza and need to be eliminated before piece can be achieved.",2023-10-12 03:52:52

I don't know the numbers but I'm willing to bet that  Hamas has committed far more war crimes than Israel (they often fire rockets deliberately at civilians for instance). But even if you assume that the numbers are balanced Israel does mostly when they respond to Palestinian attacks. Then there's the institutional response of both sides to their combatants committing war crimes. In Israel at worst, these things are controversial with some hardliners supporting them and the majority condemning them. Baruch Goldstein was not a soldier but it's an example I can give off the top of my head: his actions were publicly condemned by the Israeli government who proscribed their organization and took away the rifles of their Kibbutz. The Palestinian government and people on the other hand celebrate these actions widely. That's why I have a big problem with the centrist view of ""both sides bad"".

EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD BE PLACING THE VALUE OF LOVE AND RESPECT FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEING ABOVE ANY OTHER VALUE - INCLUDING GOD/RELIGION, ETHNICITY, GOVERNANCE STYLE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

If people could just do that en masse, problem solved. But people can’t do that because people are ultimately too narrow minded to handle this simple concept. People can still value their gods and ethnicities but those values must come below the top value bolded above.

Regarding governance/financial - it really should be minimalist free market capitalism with a robust supportive charity system and values toward charity/love of our fellow human beings across the globe. There will be some controversial elements to all this but my bolded paragraph remains the same.

Once this basic value structure actually changes en masse, war and hate ends.

Nor am I claiming that you are okay with unlawfully imprisoned peoples just because they are Palestinian and ‘probably’ did something bad anyway. 

I simply hope we stop saying ‘this is awful, how can you not see what’s wrong with it’ when the same can be said for the opposition. It’s constant back and forth violence and every act of aggression/resistance/defence in return only creates another situation with the same reaction. It goes on and on and on.

My uneducated guess would be that vehicle either contained some kind of explosive ordinance or was potentially carrying tanks of fuel or oxygen and exploded. There appears to be impact damage below the vehicle but not much of a crater elsewhere

If there were thousands of people taking refuge in the park, there could easily be hundreds of casualties from shrapnel. We can only hope the number is overstated. The concussive force of the explosion of that vehicle could potentially have caused serious casualties in the grass without lighting it on fire. Maybe some EOD experts or sappers could comment.

3932,"This doesn't prove anything. It just proves Israel is trying so hard to deny involvement.

Initially, I had doubts about whether Israel was responsible for bombing the hospital. However, I'm increasingly inclined to believe it. What leads me to think that?

1. The video footage from the ground shows the sound of a bomb being dropped at supersonic speed, which contradicts the footage from Al Jazeera of the failed rocket dropping at a snail's pace. 

2. the damage and the area of effect are much greater than what can be done by Hamas' small rockets. However, an Israeli missile would explain it.

3. Moreover, there is a documented history of Israel  lying and fabricating evidence about similar incidents. Then, once the incident fades from public memory, it often emerges that they were, in fact, responsible.This includes incidents such as the one involving the death of a reporter .
and the strike that claimed the lives of five children, eventually Israeli officials admitted it after initially blaming Islamic Jihad, stating that it was a misfired rocket from them.

Just recently, Netanyahu tried to deceive his own people by hiring someone to pretend he had family among the hostages, so he could gain praise in front of the families of the hostages.

Aside from that, what about the 111 other schools and medical structures that were bombed? The refugee camps? The exit points of the country that civilians had been instructed by Israel to head to? I don’t care the reason any side gives. Bombing the most densely populated civilian areas in the world indiscriminately is against every law of war and human rights. But as the Palestinians say, ‘you’re just watching now, but the other side has been doing this to us for fifty years’. Now why do we choose to gloss over that fact when there are endless accounts of these instances documented and instead look for ways to convince ourselves it isn’t so by debating technicalities? I’ll tell you why. It’s because we like Israel more. Because they look like us, because they present themselves to be more similar to us, because we’ve all had our hearts twisted knowing what they went through during the holocaust, they’re cemented in our minds as the underdogs, even when that is clearly no longer the case.

Israeli agencies (known for superior intelligence in arab-israel war and up until now) let this happen and organizes it even. General public only gets to know what is shown. Palestinians control such a small space with such tight perimeter around them, there is no way they cannot see paraglides/technicals and all sorts of things piling up. You can easily find people motivated to do this in Palestine which see terror and voilance by Israel on a daily basis. If you had your family member shot in the face on monday and someone comes the next day, here is a opportunity for you then 10/10 they will take it. 

Now Israel will take and have full advantage to attack in anyway they want. We can only imagine what horror and terror they will show. US suddenly approving 4.5 billion aid to an already sophisticated army against who? Basic militia, just now in another sub people making fun of tractors crossing in and shot by gunboat.

People, it is not about taking sides but about reading news and using your intellect to know what is really going on. And calm your hatred and biases when analyzing the situation. 

People! condemn what is wrong and understand who is behind and who gets the ultimate advantage. 

Israel wants to make their 3rd temple ultimately, this gives them all go ahead to first unleash bombing in that area and say oh no collateral as you guys attacked us on Sabbath. Any religion you follow or are atheist, remember the benefactor and war is engaged by people who are strong.

There was no way Hamas was going to conquer entire Israel and if they even take a village it will be cleared by like local police. 

Be wise, and remember be knowledgeable before you propagate and approve further war. Understand your biases and hatred within you and say the truth even if it goes against you.

Israel uses different weaponry depending on the target. If you are looking for a big crater to assign blame you won't find one. The Israelis use a different missile to hit cars.

Brashly, Israel made this decision knowing that civilians would be killed - they thought the collateral damage was necessary.

On the other hand, what’s going on right now in Gaza might be a lot more trouble than most people in Hamas had expected. Even if they had imagined this scenario, the reality of being in it might be different than they’d imagined.

And it could be that people in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, etc. may simply be more horrified by the videos coming out than they thought they’d be. 

Maybe they see videos and understand how stupid the situation is, given that all that stood between Gaza and a Haifa quality of life six weeks ago was the Hamas push-them-into-the-sea rhetoric.

If so, it could be that some of the same officials hollering at Israel in public are telling Hamas leaders to make peace in private. 

So, it’s completely possible that Hamas will look for a face saving way to surrender. 

The problem is to figure out how to make the surrender safe enough for Israel to make it possible to accept a surrender. 

I think that Gaza needs to accept a buffer zone patrolled by some combination of NATO people. Egyptians and UAE people, and the United States needs to help Israel put up some kind of system that instantly incinerates a three-block area around anyone who launches a rocket in Gaza. Gaza rocket launching has to end.

If you go back to history, then you can find out that the Reich saw some allies in the Muslims in the form of a common hostility to the British, or, of course, to the Jews.  There was such a diplomat in Adolf's subordinates, his name was Eberhard von Storer.  So, the war is coming, covering all large territories, and in 1942, the Islamic Institute opens in Berlin, at the opening ceremony of which the Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, spoke.  To understand who this mufti was, just read his phrase, said to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop: «It goes without saying that the Arabs are friends of Germany, since they are fighting three common enemies: the British, the Jews and Bolshevism».  Or even a performance on German radio, where he spoke the following:  Stand up as one and fight for your sacred rights.  Kill Jews, where you only find them.  This is pleasing to God, history and religion.  It will save your honor».  In general, this Muslim righteous person was actively used as a talking head for the Islamic world, he was broadcast both in the German-language press and on Arabic radio, talking about the fact that the Jews are enemies of Islam since the time of Muhammad, that they rule as in the USA, so  and in the communist union.  And, according to him, the Second World War was unleashed by ""World Jewry"".  This fighter worked very closely for the oppressed Muslims and with Himmler, preparing imams for the additional washing of Muslims who served in the German troops on the Eastern Front, and for his work this creation received 90 thousand German marks, and, one must believe, that was very enough.  The figure is significant, isn't it?  Alimjan Idris.  He was an imam, worked with Muslims in Germany even during the First World War, compared to al-Hussein, propagated the Nazi ideology in the middle of the Islamic world, and also translated ""Main Kampf"" (the political manifesto of Nazi Germany) into Persian, worked in the occupied territories of the USSR  , agitating among Muslims studying in Germany.  Under the work of this duo, Waffen-SS divisions are formed in the German army (this is, conventionally speaking, troops from legions) from Muslim units.  As an example, you can take SS ""Khandshar"", the members of which wore a patch on the lapel of their uniform, on which was depicted a scimitar covering the Nazi swastika.

You isolate it and sometimes forget to feed it. Then one day it bites you and kills one of your children. No one would be surprised. The animal would be put down and you would never be held accountable. The difference is that these are people being treated like animals and Israel is trying to put them down.

4186,"I mean, i support israel, but they ""could"" as well, the problem is such things are a non-option for either side, for various reasons including internal conflict/stability. Israel ""has"" to bomb and invade gaza, or they risk imploding. Hamas ""cant"" release the hostages or they risk imploding, also most of them are probably dead.

It's important to note that while Israel could be doing a hell of a lot worse, they could be doing a hell of a lot better at engaging Hamas and being more proactive about it in sensible ways like constant drone coverage to more immediately strike Hamas targets/launch sites rather than bombing every undermined house Hamas fled hours earlier. One effective strike in twenty isn't sustainable, and bombs no matter how precise they are can quickly resemble carpet bombing. It is also important to know that there's a lot of international and internal politics hamstringing Israel from improving.

Meanwhile there's a lot of international politics supporting Hamas even if they claim humanitarian reasons, If you don't enforce your aid actually going to civilians, and engage terrorists who steal supplies, then your aid is going to be stolen to support terrorists. It's why Hamas loves the un so much.

After the horrors of the Holocaust, the vast majority of the civilized world recognized the right of the Jewish people to possess a homeland of their own on their own historical lands. Unfortunately, that resulted in a problem that even Solomon could not solve - how to cut the baby in half to satisfy both mothers without harming the child!

Today, both Jews and Palestinians are in the right but instead of recognizing each other’s justifiable divisions and trying to come to reasonable reconciliation, they have chosen confrontation. As some Shakespearean character once exclaimed “ a pox upon both their houses”!

Undeniably, Israelis have every right to hunt and exterminate those terrorists who conduct vicious attacks upon their citizenry but the same respect for human life must be applied to the innocent citizens of Gaza. Israel has crossed the line! The indiscriminate murder of innocent Palestinians in their homes and in their hospitals is every bit as reprehensible as the Holocaust. Young Palestinian children do not deserve mutilation or death anymore than a Jewish child. Israel’s present behavior is costing it the support and respect of its multiple worldwide friends.

> Sometimes I write about discrimination, and people send me emails about their own experiences. Many sound like this real one (quoted here with permission) from a woman who studied computer science at MIT and now works in the tech industry:

>>In my life, I have never been catcalled, inappropriately hit on, body-shamed, unwantedly touched in a sexual way, discouraged from a male-dominated field, told I couldn’t do something because it was a boy thing, or suffered from many other experiences that have traditionally served as examples as ways that women are less privileged. I have also never been shamed for not following gender norms (e.g. doing a bunch of math/science/CS stuff); instead I get encouraged and told that I’m a role model. I’ve never had problems going around wearing no make-up, a t-shirt, and cargo pants; but on the rare occasion that I do wear make-up / wear a dress, that’s completely socially acceptable…Hopefully my thoughts/experiences are helpful for your future social justice based discussions.

> ...

> The woman I quote above mentions that she’s a feminist who believes discrimination is a major problem – which has only made it extra confusing to her that she never experiences any of it personally.

For years many Americans and I had concerns about the use of force by Israelis.  We believed Palestinians needed freedom, that they were being oppressed unjustly.

Then, in the span of a weekend that all changed.  It became obvious very quickly that the majority of Palestinians support Hamas and support terrorism.  They support the murder of children just as a way to hurt Israel.

All these feelings we had for Palestinians, it's out the window now.  

The realities of the situation are:

1. Hamas is the official government of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

2. Being as Hamas is the official government of Gaza, their attack on Israel was a declaration of war.

3. There will be no further sympathy, Hamas has made us choose between the genocide of Israelis and the genocide of Palestinians, we obviously will side with Israel.

They f'd around and found out, I don't care if people say ""Hamas doesn't care about the Palestinians"", somebody should tell the Palestinians that.  Because at this point I don't f'ing care about Palestinians either.  I did, but the actions of the Palestinian government changed that.",2023-10-10 15:12:39

Not a lot of people in the west understand this however. War crimes abd terrorism are just that, call a spade a spade. Idf and Hamas are guilty of both at times, and it's irrelevant to look at who killed more or who started it when you're talking about real lives and trauma. It feels like the free Palestine movement will take a big knock from this, nobody wants to associate with the idiots celebrating rape and beheading even if we know that's a small minority, many of whom aren't even from Palestine, and many of the victims weren't even Jewish or Israeli let alone supporters of Zionism. 

To me, being pro Palestine also means being pro Israel - and by that, I mean wanting freedom for both sides. Liberal, moderate and open Israelis are also victims of their government as well as any action by Palestine (whether retaliatory or not.) Jews the world over are forced to answer and give their opinions on israel and fall further victim to hatred and xenophobia. The millions upon millions of Muslims who condemn terrorist acts will further be thrown under the bus. There needs to be open discussion on how you can be pro palestinian freedom while admitting that means freeing them both from occupation by Israel AND by terrorist parties like Hamas. I still support the people of Palestine but this has just made me even more vocal about the nuances of it, and how support doesn't mean you support all actions blindly. I have Israeli friends, some of whom had friends at that party. They were by and large very liberal, anti occupation and pro palestinian but now joining the idf to defend. So well done Hamas, for radicalising the people who wanted your land to be free.

A little more history for those wanting to 'restore Palestine'.

In 132 AD the Emperor Hadrian resolved to stamp the Jews and their religion out of existence. He sold all Jewish prisoners into slavery after the revolt of Bar Kikhba, forbade the teaching of the Torah, renamed the province Syria Palaestina, and changed Jerusalem’s name to Aelia Capitolina. He renamed Israel to wipe out the national identity of Israel and the Jews.

So if you are looking to 'restore Palestine to the Palestinians', you need to give it back to the Jews

The main loser in every conflict has always been the Palestinians. That’s the tragedy of it; stuck between states that don’t really care if they live or die.

 Why is it, in the discourse about all of this, I havent seen insofar anyone mention the *original* area of Mandatory Palestine, that was both east and west of the Jordan river, which all fell under the British Mandate after the Ottomans fell, but the area was  split along the river to compromise with the Arab Delegation and that's why the eastern part of *Mandatory Palestine* was under Hashemite jurisdiction?  

Why didnt palestinians take it up with Jordan, or at least with Jordan as well? The area of Mandate Palestine east of the Jordan *is* much larger after all, AND Jerusalem at the time was half under arab jurisdiction with exclusive access to Al-Aqsa, if I understand the timeline. 

What am I missing?",2023-10-19 21:30:57
4408,"I have posted this information elsewhere, but it seems germane to this thread:

My concern is that not only does Islam promote evil in its scriptures, its followers have a disproportionate habit of embracing evil, as compared to other philosophies. And when it comes down to it, the present conflict is really a war between competing ideologies.

The Quran has multiple passages commanding that non-Muslims should be killed. Here's one (9:5): *Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.*

Take a look at the decline in Jewish populations in Muslim-majority countries over the years here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish\_exodus\_from\_the\_Muslim\_world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world). As you can see, **the population of Jews dropped from \~500,000 to \~3,000 in North Africa, and from \~300,000 down to \~400 in the Middle East, from 1948 to today**.

Compare that to the populations of people in Gaza/West Bank ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics\_of\_the\_State\_of\_Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_State_of_Palestine)), where you can see the population has *increased* from 2.8 million in 1997, to 5.2 million in 2021.

In short, Muslim countries have a consistent track record of getting rid of minority groups through violence and threats of violence. The same can not be said of Israel.

Equally as shocking, about half of Muslim people polled in the Middle East and Africa in 2013 believed that Sharia Law should be the law of the land, and that it should apply to all people, including non-Muslims ([https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/)). While an understanding of what Sharia Law entails varies by region, **over half of Muslims polled in Muslim-majority countries said that leaving Islam should be punishable by death!** On top of that, over half of Muslims in those countries believe in severe criminal punishment (chopping off the hands of thieves).

I am very pro-Muslim, which means, of course, that I am anti-Islam. My hope is that those infected by the virulent ideology can be made free, so that peace in the region can be possible.",2023-10-20 13:03:50

I am jewish myself but I never understood the sentiment of Jewish people needing a home country because they have nowhere to go. There are other civilization that have no country for their own, the kurds for example. Sure there is Kurdistan but it is only an autonom region.
What makes jews so special? Because they were victims of the holocaust? There have been genocides all over the world for many millenia. Do they deserve it because they lived there 2000 years ago? Should we just ignore modern borders and reorganize the world like it was thousands of years ago? 
Religion is what makes a civilization ""dark and primitive"", that goes for any religion.
Countries like Iran or Afghanistan once were free. Then religion destroyed them and the West gave it its last push off the cliff. Religion also leads many jews to believe a strangers man home is theirs, but it is not.
Also America and Europe played a big role in destroying the middle east by strategically destroying their economies, making the populations chronically uneducated and poor.

The historical context is unique per country. There has always been historical waves for over a thousand years of peaceful and prosperous coexistence between Muslims and Jews, and outright oppression. Which includes violence and pogroms. This led to massive migration to Israel because of this violence. Which got worse after 1948 and 1967. It's ironic because most Jews did enjoy and had cultural ties to their countries like Morocco. It was only Muslim violence and anger after the creation of Israel and the war. Ironic right? Jews would have stayed if the Muslims treated them better.

But to your point before about housing is also a little more complicated. While some did leave permanently, some did not. Morocco is a good example where the original houses were still owned by Jewish immigrants to Israel because they would come back from time to time. You have to understand identities. They were ""Moroccan Jews"". They had spent a millennia there. They ate cous cous on Fridays even though they weren't going to a mosque. They praised the king. They were Moroccan Jews. Even now King Mohammed the 6th chief advisor is a Jew. His grandfather King Mohammed 5th shielded his Jewish population in WW2.

4468,"> years ago, these arab countries were full of jewish people woth good life and a lot of money

That means that these Arab country have lived side by side to their jewish neighbor and since you said they had a good life so you mean they weren't persecuted for being jewish right? That means that the Arab countries were not anti-Semitic before 1948، so what changed? 

What has changed was the zionist militia known as Lehi among other groups (that even Israel itself designated them terrorists groups but that was after establishing the country) commiting genocide in many arab villages in the british mandate of Palestine, and later on the creation of a country called Israel or so called the state of the jewish people with David Ben-Gurion as it's prime minister (a European immigrant) and a government predominantly consisting of European immigrants known as Ashkenazi  jews 

This has prompted the neighboring Arab countries to declare war which they lost 

The result of that war was the explosion of the Arabic Palestinian population (Christians & Muslims) to neighboring countries to live the rest of the lives as refugees, or what's known as in  the Arab world as the  Palestinian Refugees of the 48.

In Response to that: many jews in Arabic nation were expelled to Israel


Now as to why the number of Arabs living in Israel is much higher to the number of jews in Arabic nation is contributed to two reasons IMO

1- before the 40s arabs were a majority in Palestine, so of course they will stay in large number, but their percentage of the total population has shrinked from more than 80% to only 20%, meanwhile jews were already a minority in the other arabic nations.


2- Personally if I were a jew living in an Arabic land, and I have to choose between incentive programs to settle in Israel vs being in danger from some idiot extremist coming to attack me for the crime of others, I would choose the former, 


So in conclusion I would like to say that all of this has been initiated by the zionist movement and this is what gave boost to radical Islam

So, after the creation of Israel, they left, not because they were persecuted, but because they wanted to live in a Jewish country, and taking Palestine was a victory for them.

I don't care about your position in the conflict, but don't try to change history to paint an image of Arabs that never existed. Want some history? White people are the ones who massacred Jews, and I'm not only speaking about the holocaust. Long before that, they treated Jews as an inferior ethnicity (similar to what they are doing today to Arabs); they persecuted them and never made them feel at home. One simple thing to note is that all Israeli dishes are either North African or Arab, not European, which shows who welcomed them. So, anti-Semitism never existed in Arab countries and would never exist (and it is strictly forbidden by religion).

I see many people trying to explain the opposition of Arab countries to Israel as anti-Semitism, trying to portray them as the ""devils. I think they don’t love them for a simpler reason: because they took other people's land and killed and raped all who stood against them. And the cherry on top, they present themselves as victims and the Palestinians as the devil (I said PALESTINIANS, not HAMAS).

4473,"Doesn’t matter, Palestinians are Arabs that don’t want to live under Israeli authority.
If Israel annexes the West Bank and Gaza, and dissolves the PLO, do you really believe that Palestinians will have the same full and equal rights as Israelis? In some settlements in the West Bank, Palestinians aren’t allowed to own businesses or even walk on certain streets. And do you really think we will have equal representation in government? Maybe under a different government, but under Netanyahu I don’t think it’s possible. 

The whole justification for complete Israeli annexation, that Israelis make better use of the land because “Arabs bomb and Israelis build”, stinks of colonialism.",2023-10-19 14:21:45
4474,"You are right, numbers don't lie:

According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza on Wednesday, more than 3,470 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its bombardment in response to the attack by the militant group Hamas on October 7. Of those, about 1,200 have been children, according to the Defense for Children International — Palestine on Wednesday.
Israel is apartheid and on a mission for ethnic cleansing, killing and bombing every building they wish. The whole Israel is IDF, Gaza is literally under Marshall law, all the statistics were online from 2021, Hamas started the attack but IDF was sleeping? Why people aren't seeing the bigger picture? Israel will not stop killing until they've wiped every single Muslim Palestinian",2023-10-19 16:55:19
4475,"Weren't most these numbers caused BECAUSE of the creation of Israel ? Rather than a reason for this decrease ?  

Both pull factors to Israel and push factors were into play. It would seem logical that the most dominant reason would be pull factors, cause a country was literally just created for people of their religion. Need more sources though, you can't just throw numbers and say it was because they were chased away. 

>Years ago, these Arab countries were full of so many amazing Jewish communities with a good life and a lot of money who were forced to move from there to Israel because of anti-Semitism, pogroms and violence perpetrated in them by their muslims neighbors and to build the country from scratch, with no money and with a basic and poor living, but have you ever seen a Jew who claims ownership About his old home in Morocco or Tunisia?

Why are you simply ignoring the pull factors from Israel ? You're making it seem like they were expelled while in multiple of these countries Jews willingly migrated, not per se because of persecution. At least back this up with sources next time. 

>No - because we decided to build a wonderful country and focus on the good and not like our neighbors just keep crying that they want their country back even though in practice there was almost nothing here.

>And one last thing - pay attention to all the Arab countries I mentioned or even to Gaza, pay attention to the standard of living there that does not come close to Israel and it is not for nothing, the regimes there are dark and primitive and if a day comes and Israel falls and Palestine rises here in its place, we all probably understand that it will be another counry sponsored by terrorism And darkness and not the amazing advance and high-tech nation that Israel built.

*cough* America *cough*. That last sentence is such a bootlicking thing to say, even for your own country. You don't even realize none of this would be real if it wasn't for other countries supporting you. And ofc you wouldn't cry for stolen land, you're the one who claimed it.

First of all no one was moved against their will 
Jews (people i personally know) in tunisia (my country) had a chance to move and were encouraged to go being promised free land and financial help to start over but they refused 
Second the land wasn't nothing in 1948, rightful owners were kicked out of their homes, okay sure it wasn't all castles and villas and modern cities the way it is now but for a third world country in 1948 there were houses populated by Palestinians.
Finally your logic simply doesn't make sense, if you have a house with 3 bedrooms and you're using only 1 it doesn't give me the right to move in and populate the other two just because they're there (what you claim happened in 1948) and after trying to kick me out of your house I move you to the garage and basically lock  you there and abuse you daily just for trying to get your house back (what's actually going on now)",2023-10-19 15:43:32

The last month has felt like a blur. 

We were on a family trip to Israel when the Oct 7th attack occurred. It’s been over a month, and our 12-year old still panics at any loud noise. What could have prepared a New York-born child to deal with terrifying sirens, warning that she has 60 seconds to get to a bomb shelter as rockets are firing towards her? A cousin was ambushed and killed by Hamas terrorists with machine guns. Virtually everyone in our community has suffered the loss of a loved one, or has a loved one who endured injuries, or one who lives in fear, repeatedly seeking refuge in bomb shelters. 

Back in New York, things aren’t much better. Our 9-year came home from school in tears, claiming an adult labeled him a “baby-killer,” and he just couldn’t understand why. Neither could we. Where is all this hate coming from? We’ve attempted to raise awareness, and perhaps to help us deal with our own emotional turmoil, by taping up posters of the hostages on our office front, only to have them torn down by the ignorant and the hateful. Our daughter spent the weekend at a friend in Brooklyn, but instead of their planned day out, they were forced to shelter at home for 2 days, heeding the warning of the police department to the Jews in the area: “There will be a Palestinian protest this weekend, with plausible threats to your community. And we do NOT have the resources to protect you.”

Each passing week, the news brings more alarming, heartbreaking reports of antisemitic incidents, revealing a world that we had hoped was finally beginning to embrace us, but instead seems to have been concealing a deep-seated hatred reminiscent of the animosity our grandparents faced in Europe in World War II. Never again? Did it ever really end?

We wish and pray that one day the world will see that we are nothing more than a quirky little harmless bunch, with some clever ideas to contribute to this wonderful world that we all share. And live our lives in peace. And to finally after two thousand years, unpack our bags and feel like we’re home. 

Your words made us feel something unfamiliar. That we are NOT alone.

Thank you for your kindness. We love you. We hope only the best for you and your community. With all of our hearts.",2023-11-18 20:46:47

I agree full-heartedly. No more explaining. No more trying to get soulless nutjobs to sympathize/empathize with Israel's plight. No more letting people call me a whatever-ist and whatever-phobe simply because I think Hamas was in the wrong, and they're getting what was coming to them.

I hope the death of children and babies stops soon, for the sake of all sides, not just Israel, but what do you expect? Of course civilian casualties are going to be relatively high when the enemy (Hamas) scurries under tunnels like the rats they are, which are of course connected to hospitals, schools and residences.

I saw that Hamas leader clip where he said ""Palestinians are a martyrdom nation"", and that just shocked me to the core, how he literally says ""all can die **FOR** me, that's their **purpose**"", absolutely disgusting. 

Another clip when he said they built tunnels for themselves, and the UN and Israel are responsible for civilian life. 

A report of IDF where Hamas just sent a 100 women and children towards a brigade of soldiers and tanks, as a human wall, so they can escape.

I'm going to use this as an opportunity to say something I've said before.  This should be headed as a warning to everyone on the planet.  Keep your government in check so another nation doesn't have to.  

Sometimes, keeping your government in check comes at a high price, but waiting for another nation to do it for you comes at a higher price.  And, sometimes, it's simply not possible.  This is why when you're given the ability to vote for your government, do so wisely.  Once you vote in tyranny you'll not be able to vote it out.

Agree with you, 100%.  Hamas tactics are designed to bring misery on Gazans.  They are suicidal and crazy. 

> I wish they were more calculated because it’s simply wrong to kill 400 Palestinian civilians just to target one Hamas member (the refugee camp).

FWIW I doubt those numbers. Israel would have no reason to use a device that powerful to kill a single person.  Obviously blowing up someone in a crowd isn't going to not kill and injure others but 400 people consume a lot more space than one. 

That being said.... Israel so far has mainly gone after stuff not people in their bombing.  Weakening al-Qassam enough that Hamas surrenders is going to be a lot dead even if we assume 1.5 civilians for every 1 al-Qassam.

4624,"The idea that ""all Palestinians agree with Hamas"" is complete fiction. It gets repeated over and over again on this sub and elsewhere on the internet by supporters of Israel.

In fact, polling has consistently shown limited and reluctant support for Hamas among the Palestinian people, with a clear majority of Palestinians supporting a two-state solution (i.e., recognizing and respecting the right of Israel to exist). 

See the results of polls conducted this July:

https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah

Also, as OP acknowledges, the proportion of Palestinians claiming to ""support"" Hamas is probably greatly exaggerated, because Hamas is known for its intimidation tactics against anyone who dares to speak out against it. 

Moreover, it's important to remember that for those Palestinians whose lives are negatively affected by Israeli policies (i.e., people whose freedom of movement is restricted, who have been removed from their homes, or whose family or friends have been persecuted or killed), Hamas represents the *only* current means of opposing Israel. They may not agree with Hamas's extremist/fundamentalist ideology, but if its the only powerful authority available to them other than Israel (which is actively oppressing them), what alternative do they have? 

This is the fundamental problem of the region. People are suffering as a result of Israeli policies, and they have no means of resistance other than Hamas - and if they tried to resist by other means, both Israel and Hamas would shut them down in a heartbeat. 

And now Israel just made their lives 10x harder. The result will be that more Palestinians will change from ""reluctant supporters of Hamas based on self-interest"" to ""die-hard ideological Israel-haters"", and Hamas will get stronger, which will make it even harder for non-extremist Palestinians to express any kind of autonomy in the face of persecution.

Israeli here!
Indeed, there is a big population of israeli arabs, not necessarily Muslims, but also Christians, Baha'i Druze and Bedouin.
Israel is not committed to genocide, and although generally, most of these communities live apart in their own villages, some live together in the same city, like Jaffa which is near Tel Aviv, or a better example is Haifa, which is the third biggest city in israel, and inhabits all of those people, from all of those different backgrounds and religions side by side.

That being said, this is not black and white. Just as there are israelis that are dedicated for peace and co existent, there are also Israelis who are too frightened, and consequently too stupid to see anything but blind hatred towards arabs, regardless of their respective religion.

It's quite unkown to the public as well, but the left wing and right wing in israel are actually regarded to that conflict... Right wing politics mostly are people who don't believe co existent can be made dully possible with the palestinians, and focus more heavily on militant power, while the left wing is way more focused on peace and coexistent.
If that ain't clear, unfortunately, israel is right now under a toxic leadership of a far right PM.

They think Arabs are making a choice to stay separated and within the Gaza ghetto, and under the bombs 'meant for Hamas'. Arabs say they are being treated like second class citizens in Israel so they won't accept Israel as their country (there is some evidence of this) and quite a lot of the moderate to radical Muslims reject living in a country like Israel where Judaism is the official religion - for obvious reasons. I think these perspectives, esp the Western/Israeli view that Arabs choose to stay there, they choose to remain in their houses when warned about bombs, they chose to reject Israeli nationality etc etc etc and just the refusal to see the other perspective is what causes wildly differing views on genocide. Seems like a good chunk of humans are well past the whole 'Palestine is an occupied country' part... It did happen a long time ago and I doubt Israel will stop existing and be handed back to Palestinians. The refusal to move on from that part of history is what causes a lot of confusion, I think.

In no way is Israel committing genocide in this sense, and no reasonably well informed person would think otherwise.

When you hear folks describing Israel as committing genocide, they are referring to the UN Convention on Genocide, and are (either inadvertently, or intentionally) misinterpreting the language of that convention to support the idea that Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza fit the bill.

The convention defines genocide extensively, and is often quoted as defining genocide as, ""crimes committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" The logic of those quoting it in this way is that a) Israel must want to destroy Palestinians, or at least the Palestinian *identity* and b) it has committed crimes (e.g., illegal settlements in the West Bank).

This quote is from a [UN Fact Sheet](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/Genocide%20Convention-FactSheet-ENG.pdf), which goes on to point out that attacks on political groups, or so-called cultural genocide are *not* part of the definition (so destroying the Palestinian identity would not constitute genocide, to the UN). Moreover, the actual convention specifies a specific list of acts, of which ""illegal settlements"" is not one:

* (a) Killing members of the group;
* (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
* (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
* (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
* (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Some folks argue that Israel is committing genocide anyhow, because they believe that Israel has the intent to destroy the Palestinians (and simply hasn't done it in any large scale, yet). They point to the ""in whole or in part"", the fact that ""killing members of the group"" doesn't specify a quantity, etc. They point to the idea that Israel wants to remove Palestinians from given areas (e.g., Area C) as evidence, suggesting that even a small amount of deaths in the service of removing the population = genocide.

The same [fact sheet](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/Genocide%20Convention-FactSheet-ENG.pdf) addresses that:

>To constitute genocide, there must be a proven intent on the part of perpetrators to physically destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Cultural destruction does not suffice, nor does an intention to simply disperse a group, though this may constitute a crime against humanity as set out in the Rome Statute 

So anyone that says, ""Israel is committing genocide,"" has set a pretty high bar for themselves. In order to make that statement truthfully (rather than as a deliberately misleading rhetorical ploy), they'd need to demonstrate that:

* Israel's government wants to eliminate the Palestinian nation
* Israel is deliberately killing Palestinians in order to destroy the Palestinian people as a whole
* The killing of Palestinians by the Israeli government is not in service of a military objective or to kill specific Palestinians based on their political affiliation (e.g., to Hamas), but is part of a deliberate strategy to wipe out the Palestinian people

There's little doubt that Israel's actions have resulted and will continue to result in serious bodily harm to a large part of the Palestinian population, but I guess you could argue that it's not the intent, to destroy Palestinians *as such*, since the actual targets are Hamas. So ""peopleslaughter"" as a slightly lesser crime than ""genocide"" might be a good fit.

There are two key elements to take into account here: the intention to physically destroy the group, in whole or in part, that is, to provoke a demographic implosion of the group; and the means necessary to accomplish it.

Examples of genocide are the Jewish Holocaust (2/3 of Europe's Jewry murdered between 1941 and 1945), the Rwandan genocide (800,000 Tutsis murdered in just one hundred days), or the Armenian genocide (1.5 million Armenians murdered in 1915).

Israel's policies towards the Palestinians do clearly fit neither the general definition of genocide nor any of the examples cited above. Palestinians never suffered a demographic implosion under Israel, in fact their population has been massively growing during Israel's occupation. They were never destroyed as a people, in whole or in part.

Never 2/3 of the Palestinian people were murdered in a four-year period, like them Jews during the Holocaust; never 800,000 Palestinians were murdered in a 100-day period, like them Tutsis; and never 1.5 million Palestinians were murdered during the course of a single year, like them Armenians.",2023-10-17 11:58:09

The presence of Palestinians living in Israel stems from the historical and complex nature of the land. Before 1948, Palestinians coexisted with Jewish communities, and there was a significant level of harmony. To illustrate, I come from Tunisia, an Arab and Muslim country, yet we maintain numerous synagogues and Jewish heritage sites. One of the most famous ones is Ghriba in Djerba, attracting Jews from around the world to practice their religion. Remarkably, these sites are protected by the government, despite Tunisia's support for Palestine and its non-recognition of Israel as a legitimate state.

The situation in the region primarily boils down to politics, not religion.

These are the stages of genocide:

Classification – Dividing people into ‘them’ and ‘us’. — Calling Israel innocent but Palestine terrorists 

Symbolisation – Forcing groups to wear or be associated with symbols which identify them as different.

Discrimination – Excluding groups from participating in civil society, such as by excluding them from voting or certain places. In 1930s Germany, for example, Jews were not allowed to sit on certain park benches. — Not allowing them on certain streets in West bank

Dehumanisation – To deny the humanity of one group, and associate them with animals or diseases in order to belittle them. — calling Palestinians ""human animals""

Organisation – Training police or army units and providing them with weapons and knowledge in order to persecute a group in future. — training the IDF and putting them in Gaza and the west bank

Polarisation – Using propaganda to polarise society, create distance and exclude a group further. — saying hamas beheaded babies and saying it was their rocket that bombed the hospital

Preparation – Planning of mass murder and identifying specific victims. — bombing hospitals and anything they can

Persecution – Incarcerating groups in ghettos or concentration camps , forcibly displacing groups, expropriating property, belongings or wealth. — kidnapping Palestinians and putting then in prison even kids, kicking people out of their homes for settlers to live in 

Extermination – Committing mass murder. — bombing everything in sight

Denial – Denial of any crimes. This does not necessarily mean denying that the acts of murder happened, but denying that these acts were a crime, and were in fact justified. — denying the genocide that is happening, saying Israel is defending itself when they really aren't

4730,"Let me shed some light here as a Muslim. The only Palestinian territories left are Gaza and the West Bank. The Arabs/Muslims you see are a privileged few  that got the “golden ticket” otherwise known as an Israeli permit to come and live in Jerusalem and other cities like Tel Aviv. 

The Arabs/Muslims you’re running into probably have Western citizenship like US or UK and are most likely asked to denounce any semblance of their Palestinian heritage for an Israel passport in the insanely rare case they do receive one (Israeli government and Ministry of Affairs make this a very difficult process intentionally). 

You said you were there for a month as a tourist. Israeli department of tourism make it so that anyone visiting on birthright or from the West only see what they want them to see, they make sure that you’re getting the image of glitz and glam while you’re there so you can go out and say great things about how fair and just they are.  They intentionally make it so that you are not allowed to visit the occupied sites “for your own safety” but really they don’t want you to see the gruesome reality of what they’re doing to those people in the world’s largest open-air prison, according to the UN.

Trust me when I tell you if you began to peel back the layers you’ll find out that Arab citizens in Israel do not have the same kind access to schools as Israelis do. They do not have the same equal access to education that Israelis do. In some cases they are not allowed to attend the same schools and even for the very few that are — they are not treated the same by their school peers. Arabs cannot travel freely around the country as easily and as openly as Jews. Arabs are also not allowed to buy/sell property as freely and again this process makes it extremely difficult for them to live in Jerusalem. That’s if they are not pushed out first. Israeli national law also does not work in their favor whatsoever. 9/10 cases are usually lost if you were to bring a case to court as an Arab/Muslim. 

Arabs are constantly monitored and looked down upon everywhere they go. Even if that means they’re an allowed to get married and practice their faith. Most of the times they are denounced when praying in public — and in Ramadan the holiest Muslim month they were received with tear gas at their place of worship at Masjid Al Aqsa — the third holiest mosque in the Muslim religion that the right-wing Israeli government wants to tear down and replace with what they think The Temple of the Mount should be. 

While the Temple used to be there many thousands of years ago, Islam came after Judaism as another branch of religions of Abraham and the mosque was built there after the Temple was destroyed by the Roman Empire. 

Israelis are essentially punishing Arabs for crimes they didn’t commit. That is against international law and is known as “collective punishment” and they have been doing this since the inception of the state of Israel in 1948. Punishing an ethnic/religious group for the crimes of one small terrorist group “Hamas”. 

Hamas was not even formed until 1987 and was seen as a last resort — a form of resistance when anything resembling peace (see Oslo Accords) failed to see the light of day. Also, a couple of years back Palestinians tried to peacefully get corporations to support and implement the BDS movement (boycott, divestment and sanctions) aimed at driving business away from corporations that were actively funding Israel that allowed it to continue its war crimes. The BDS movement failed because no corporation was willing to stand in the face of “antisemitism”. However Palestinians just want equal rights. There is nothing antisemitic about equal opportunity, travel, healthcare, property and education for all.

Israel have one of the best militaries in the world, have access to some of the best nuclear weaponry in the world as well as medicine and tech. THAT is why this is genocide, Gazans don’t have clean water, fuel or electricity. Even war has rules and there’s always an oppressor and oppressed. 

Think about why Israel is being painted as the victim in all Western media outlets when it has consistently reigned hellfire and terror on Palestinian civilians for 70+ years and displaced them out of their homes. Ask yourself why would a country suffering from terrorist attacks and radical Islam, receiving millions of dollars in aid and support from the USA have to advertise the attack on YouTube ads and Twitter ads to “raise awareness” while Gazan aid from Egypt and other Arab states is destroyed by Israeli military officials before it even reaches the Gaza border. 

Also, Israel already has all major Western allies siding with it, so why the ads? Because they know public opinion + perception matters and they have always been known to be the aggressor that needs these minor attacks to happen to be able to retaliate and justify its genocidal actions. They want to convince the public it’s justified, it’s war and this is what war is like. Not true. Nyetnyahu is losing public support amongst Israelis and everyone knows public support rises when you are a “Wartime President”. I urge Americans to make parallels between him and Trump. 

As this is not a religious or ethnic war as the media would have you believe. This is a humanitarian crisis full of international war crimes. This is not an equal fight and the war is very complex in terms of special interests and serving the US needs and wants in the region. Similar to that of Iraq and “weapons of mass destruction”. The Middle East is an oil mine and thus this is all strategic. Israel is only a pawn in the US’ imperialist agenda in sucking the region dry of its resources and eliminating the threat of Iran/Russia.",2023-10-17 15:04:42

4735,"1) There is the Arab-Israeli population (citizens of Israel, about 20% of the Israeli population, face significant racism and discrimination and violence but do have full legal equal rights within Israel) and there is the Palestinian population of the occupied territories (face restrictions on their movement, land seizures, arbitrary arrest, detention without trial, murder by vigilante settlers, an entirely unjust occupying regime). It’s true that Arab citizens of Israel have equal civil rights with Jewish citizens (although there is also very real discrimination), and it’s also true that Palestinians in the occupied territories face violent repression and a regime that is analogous to apartheid. 
2) Factions of the Israeli settler movement have for years explicitly called for the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. The representatives of the most extreme factions of that movement are now in the Israeli government. The current Finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has clearly endorsed ethnic cleansing and arguably genocide. It’s been clear for years now that the current Israeli government doesn’t believe in a two-state solution and ultimately wants to build up settlements and annex the west bank. At that point the only logical outcome is either genocide, ethnic cleansing or apartheid.

I don’t think Israel wants a genocide of the Palestinians, but I do think parts of the settler movement do, and those parts are currently in the government. There are strong movements within the Israeli right that want to ban marriage between Arabs and Jews, and would like to see an end to all those things you mention (the call to prayer in Tel Aviv, the integration of ethnic minorities into Israeli society).

Overall I probably agree with you that the situation of the Palestinians doesn’t meet the criteria for genocide right now, but there is ongoing ethnic cleansing and I would argue apartheid, and the direction of travel for at least 20 years has all been in that direction. So these claims of genocide aren’t coming out of nowhere",2023-10-17 10:05:11

Also genocide isn't just mass extermination seen in the 1940s, it can also be about destroying or just degrading a language, culture, identity, like the boarding schools that native Americans were forced to attend in Canada, or the forced adoption and sterilisation of Aborigines in Australia in the 1960s.",2023-10-17 20:40:57

Israel rewarding the atrocities by giving land to Palestine? “Oh, now that we know you’re serious, by raping our women and children, here’s land and a billion dollars! NOW we get it!”

A solution is needed. I see none being proposed. Israel will not pack up and dissolve. It also has nuclear weapons so it won’t go down without several Arab nations going extinct. So that’s off the table.

What else?

Give Palestine full statehood and land? Palestine refused that over the decades. They want Israel gone which is off the table. America will sooner dissolve and give land back to the Cherokee Indians. Aka when hell freezes over.

But you seem to be unaware of the context. It is very clear that Netanyahu over the years has created extrem oppression against Palestinians. Israel has killed many more people before this incident and even in retaliation to the incident already killed more people than Hamas. Always the Palestinians die more.

For example, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been tracking deaths in the conflict since 2008 to 2020 and [its data shows](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties#) that 5,600 Palestinians  have been killed and only 250 Israelis.

Hamas only targeted soldiers and settler men. Haven't you seen the viral clips of a woman releasing her two children? And that settlement that reported that resistance fighters entered her house? 
- Do not forget that these settlers are stealers of the land, not theirs. 
Didn't you see Israel's bombing of Gaza? Hamas attacked the army and killed more than two hundred soldiers, according to a statement by the Israeli army, and captured more than two hundred as well. On the other hand, Israel succeeded in killing more than a thousand children! Some of them had their bodies turned into pieces. Pictures are everywhere unless you refuse to see them and insist on publishing your version of events and misleading people and making them think that you are the party (The poor guy) While you are the aggressor. 
- What Hamas did was a reaction, a resistance, a resistance to a state that stole the land of the Palestinians and practiced an ugly racist regime against the Muslims and Arabs there. In your right, which country is based on religion? If you are Jewish, do you have the right to obtain Israeli citizenship? What an ugly system of religion-based apartheid . 
- Even the settlers (those you call civilians) are no less bad than the Israeli army , Who burned the Dawabsha family in 2015 in Nablus? They were safe in their home until fire broke out from everywhere in their home Three individuals died, including an 18-month-old infant. Who killed Muhammad Abu Khudair and burned him in Jerusalem in 2014? Who is attacking Arabs and Muslims at home, destroying their property and ruining their stores? Between 2000 and 2010, 49 Palestinians were killed by settlers (Israeli civilians) There is no need to mention the statistics for the last years. 
- Both the settlers and the Israeli army constantly practice Zionist terrorism against the Palestinians, and the Israeli state supports them by being lenient with all their crimes, and I dare say it even supports them! 
- Hamas came as a liberation reaction, as a resistance reaction, as a voice for the Palestinian people, to put an end to this state and its practices and to recover the stolen Palestinian lands. 
As long as the settlers are as violent and dirty as the Israeli army and are the first to commit crimes against the Palestinians, do you blame Hamas for fighting them? . I mention again only the men and the soldiers.",2023-10-16 17:39:35

Facts that go against this entrenched narrative that Palestinians are underdogs are  ignored by leftists: like the fact that Palestinians are supported by 1.9 billion fellow Muslims, that Israel is a tiny country whose existence has been under threat since its inception and continues to be under threat, due to hostility from neighboring states, that Palestinians elected the theocratic terror group Hamas to represent them and still continue to support the terror group. If anything, it is Israel that is the underdog.

If you think about it, the ideology of Hamas is exactly what American leftists say they oppose: Hamas is theocratic, misogynistic, homophobic, and intolerant of all other religions - just like the Christian Nationalists in the US that the left is opposed to. But because of anti-Israel propaganda and entrenched, ahistorical narratives about Israel on the left, leftists lose sight of these inconvenient facts about the Israel-Palestine conflict and automatically side with Palestinians no matter how gruesome the Palestinians' actions are.",2023-10-16 14:07:15
4929,">I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as  guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence

Wholly disagree. It is in my opinion distinctly different when discussing Gaza. Israel's actions regarding Gaza as for the most part fully defensive (think Iron Dome) while Hamas is fully offensive. When Israel retaliates against Hamas during times of more serious terrorist attacks (such as this current one) there is a clear focus on disabling Hamas capabilities and targeting known terrorists. Yes, there are civilian casualties, but I would contend that many of them are likely due to Hamas keeping its civilians where they are, potentially against the civilians' will. Israel gives forewarning to residents of buildings before they will strike. On the other hand, Hamas' obvious goal is the total annihilation of Israel and all Jews worldwide. We saw this in action last week and are lucky that their ""call to violence"" did not lead to widespread violence around the globe (with the few small exceptions we've heard about). It's just not the same when you look at each entity's goals and actions.

As for your main point, it really is one of the best examples of cognitive dissonance I've ever seen. It really is like that [Eric Andre meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1959067874127057&set=p.1959067874127057&type=3). It is so obviously Hamas that is the root of so many problems pertaining to Gaza but so many don't see it this way. There are a few driving factors that I believe have led to Gazan support by the left:

* **9/11 and Islamophobia** \- Ever since 9/11, the US opinion towards Islam, Muslims, and the Middle East has been rough. Not saying it isn't somewhat justified but it has lead to serious racism towards Muslims in America. The far left has always been fighting against this, but in their fight, they have blindly swung to support all things that appear to look like resistance to American (or white) imperialism in the ME. By making Israel appear as a imperialist, white, and warmongering country, many leftists side with Gazans as a force of habit at this point.
* **Poor knowledge** \- This goes for both sides but I'm focusing on the left for now since this post is about them. In this day and age, rarely anyone reads past the headline of an article or gets their news from Instagram stories. This is a very bad way at understanding the situation and the history surrounding it. The left's love for making nice-wrapped-up Instagram posts trying to explain the conflict in a few infographics gives people a sense of understanding of the conflict and leaves them with a bad case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. IMO the more people understand the history of Israel, its ties to Jewish people and the circumstances of how it was formed and how Gaza came to be, the more likely they are to not take such a strong pro-Palestinian side. 
* **Cognitive Dissonance** \- I honestly don't know how else to put it that this. Seeing signs of ""Gays for Palestine"" or ""Feminists for Palestine"" really makes me scratch my head. The support coming from these groups without the realization that if they were to openly be themselves or speak about these topics in Gaza, they would most likely be stoned on the spot. I think certain groups who see themselves as marginalized in the US (LGBT+, Atheists, African Americans) think there are similarities between their beliefs and what the average Gazan's beliefs are. What they do not realize is how essentially no Gazan would rush to defend a homosexual if the tables were turned.

I could go on about Israel's right-wing, corrupt government and how that likely plays are role but my comment is long enough.

That's why they generally don't like protests and side with the police. The left sides with the protesters, because they they appear to be oppressed by the police and the system.

Obviously, there is a lot of grey area and just like right and left, there is a spectrum.

Israel, like the Jewish people, were once seen as oppressed. We are no longer the oppressed, and in their eyes, we have become the oppressors.

Certain individuals within the American liberal community seem to adhere to a somewhat perplexing notion that the weaker party in any conflict inherently embodies moral righteousness. However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that this principle isn't consistently applied. One striking example of this inconsistency lies in their response to the devastating events in Iraq, where an alarming 300,000 civilians lost their lives. Surprisingly, there appears to be a lack of genuine remorse, sympathy, or protest from these individuals, despite their professed commitment to moral justice.

This glaring discrepancy raises significant questions about the integrity and coherence of their moral stance. It prompts us to ponder whether their advocacy for the morally just cause is selective, leading to an unsettling contrast between their principles and actions. Such observations compel us to delve deeper into the underlying motivations and convictions of these individuals, shedding light on the complexities of their beliefs and the nuances of their ideological standpoints.",2023-10-16 20:58:14

Also because they've been fed the BS line that Hamad are a bunch of freedom fighters and it's all about a land grab. 

In reality, war is ugly. People on both sides will die. Collateral damage plagues both sides. There is no universe of human existence where the ideal leftist utopia of peaceful war exists. It's ugly, and it sucks royally mostly for the people who aren't actually in charge. But this is the plague of the human existence. 

And for Muslims and Jews its deeper than simply war. There is general dislike and many on both sides have generational experience that drives their mindset to one side or the other. We are basically cousins and most israeli jews and palestinians are more or less somewhat related. Even more related to each other than palestinians are to other Arabs. The problem is, when you experience a horror in your life not once, twice but many times, it starts to stick in your mind and it gets difficult to let go and move yourself back to objective thought. Especially when all the other factors impacting your life and existence are around like affording food, shelter, a job, etc.

That is not true at all. 

If it was true, the iron dome would not have been installed and Israel would let the missiles hit their civilian targets so they could parade the dead bodies in the street. I

If it was true, any foreign aid to Israel would be redirected to dig tunnels into Gaza to spring terror attacks against civilians. 

If it was true, Israel would not send warnings as to where strikes were going to land, in fact, they would be purposefully targeting those civilians. 

If it were true, Israel would launch surprise attacks like last week where they raped, murdered, beheaded and kidnapped civilians and posted it on social media.

You want to be on the left? Then you **must** be all of the following:

It all becomes a part of rage politics, and people lose the autonomy to form opinions on individual matters. Most people with even a shred of sense wouldn't need to spend long to understand that the history of the conflict is nuanced way beyond the possibility to label one side or the other as the villain.

It's also sad that for some reason it's become unfathomable for people to think along the lines of ""Hamas committed atrocities"" without whataboutism. Equally, the situation *is* nuanced, and if you want to place that comment in context, it's perfectly fine to do so without justifying it. ""Hamas committed atrocities; I understand and sympathise with the plight to the Palestinian people, but this is not acceptable.""

Same the other way around. It's unimaginable to so many people to say something like ""I support Israel's right to exist and defend itself, but I recognise that there's a point of view I don't understand well enough from the other side. And either way, while I support Israel, I *don't* support settlements in the West Bank or other aggravating activities. Or the use of excessive force.""

* There are people in the Cataclysmic School which sees war as disaster a failure of politics that does nothing but destroy things and kill people.

A good deal of religious tradition holds this view as war by itself (not just losing a war) is seen as divine punishment and peace as a blessing of God.

* There are people in the Eschatological School sees history as moving towards a goal or objective. Wars are steps along those objectives. Obama's famous line, ""History moves in the direction of justice"" requires one to believe that history has low level objectives . So he comfortably applied this to the War on Terror,""I am confident we will succeed in this mission because we are on the right side of history.”.

On the hard left you have a lot of both. Cataclysmic School are almost all on the left.  There is a 3rd school which is heavily represented in ""the establishment"" for both parties called the Realist School.  For them war is a rational instrument of national policy. In the anarchy that exists between nations, war is a means to achieve rational political objectives. War is just a more forceful form of diplomacy.

Zionists will argue that it does based on past persecution, but I'd argue the global protection of jewish people increased greatly after the Holocaust and it is possible for people to put their self interests aside to create a democracy where people are represented equally. We can look to post-apartheid South Africa for an example, there are still biases there that will take generations to undo, but it's an example.

Both ends of the extremist spectrum are trying to shut down this disagreement right now and that's the biggest problem of all, I think. Of course this gets dicey, I'm not defending hate speech, and it's sometimes hard to draw the line between what's just freedom of speech and what's actively harmful (other times quite easy).

The KGB basically organized and financed the PLO and handpicked its original leaders.

""***You do not represent Palestine  as much as we do. Never forget this one point: There is no such thing  as a Palestinian people, there is no Palestinian entity, there is only  Syria."" -*** Syrian dictator Hafez Assad to Yasser Arafat.

The idea of a unique Palestinian state distinct from its Arab neighbors  was at first rejected by Palestinian representatives. The [First Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Arab_Congress) of [Muslim-Christian Associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim-Christian_Associations) (in [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem), February 1919), which met for the purpose of selecting a Palestinian Arab representative for the [Paris Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919),  adopted the following resolution: ""We consider Palestine as part of  Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are  connected with it by national, religious, [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language), natural, economic and geographical bonds.""  Though in fairness I should acknowledge that there were some stirrings of Palestinian nationalism in the late Ottoman period.

Anyway none of this justifies violence against Palestinians, or justifies them being left stateless and dispossed.  But it is extremely important context to understand why the Palestinians don't have a state.  Essentially almost from the beginning the specific Palestinian identity has been a part of a project aimed at destroying Israel and Jewish self-determination in the Middle East.

It just happened today at a Jewish fraternity house at Georgia tech today. The way a group of people behave is a window into what they would do with power. 

In the end, the pro Palestinian movement is now a genocidal movement against Jews, particularly because it behaves like any other Jewish genocidal movement in history. For example

1) they deny the attacks last week, just as an anti semite denies the holocaust
2) you show them verifiable proof of the attacks, so they transition to “it’s not real” or accuse you of exaggeration
3) When they have no argument to documented acts of terrorism, they switch to arguing justification for the acts
4) they wrap up anti semitism in a oppressor/oppressed or colonial/anti colonial package, which is the hallmark of anti-semitism being a shapeshifting ideology. Jews are whatever popular opinion deems the worst people to be. Right now the worst thing you can be is a racist so they’ll claims Jews are that. 
5) their followers accuse “Zionists” of the same types of things a traditional anti-Semite would accuse Jews: ie they control the media, aipac controls American foreign policy, “it’s all about the Benjamin’s” is just like Jews are all about money, “American Jews have dual loyalties to America and Israel” 
6) they behave like traditional anti semites, attacking Jews in the streets under the guise of Palestinian rights, spray painting Jewish stars on homes as was done in Germany (of all places) over the weekend, 
7) most importantly the end goal of the entire Palestinian movement is NOT democracy. It is Islamist society, sharia law. It’s not just Israel they want, but the entire world.  This is clear from hamas leaders’ statements. Not that I am referring Islamism (the notion that government should an Islamic theocracy), not Islam, the religion. 

So when you see a person waiving a Palestinian flag in the US or in Europe, it is the same thing as waiving an Isis flag or an Al Qaeda one.  Because currently the Palestinian movement has no desire to disconnect from Hamas. But even if it did, they would run to the PA, whose leader overtly denies the holocaust and ALSO does not desire a democratic outcome. 

I’m not against free speech here. But don’t believe for a second that a person who supports BDS or Hamas or the Palestinian movement can be an integral part of a democratic country. That person would actively exploit democracy to pave the way for Islamic tyranny.

This is an absolute truth, not subjective: Hamas mass murdered 1300 people last week ,vast majority were civilians and some of whom were Americans.  Nearly all were Jews. And there are people that *support* this, or defend Hamas against that truth. These people live among us.

Jews have been targeted for millennia. They tried assimilating and that didn't help. See: Holocaust. Hundreds of other ethnicities get to rule themselves in their own homelands, so Jews get the opportunity to do that. People were living in Palestine but fled while Arab countries invaded Israel to eradicate the Jewish population. Israel is a country of refugees, the plurality being expelled from Arab countries and a very large amount from the Holocaust. Yet people call them colonizers. How is this not anti-semitism?

Anti-zionism is the belief that Jews don't have the right to self determination in their homeland. You don't see people fighting that concept with any other people. Uzbekistan? Country. Slovenia? Country. No one says they shouldn't exist though. It's just thinly veiled anti-semitism.

So Palestinian terrorists attack from Gaza and the West Bank and what option does Israel have but to protect itself? Hamas is literally the government of Gaza and literally calls for the destruction of the Jewish people. So Israel blockades Gaza. Egypt did it too. Only portions of the West Bank are occupied but again it's based on an existential threat to Israel. No one puts pressure on Jordan or Egypt to accept more Palestinians.

Jews tend to be in the bad people category, and muslims tend to be in the good people category. Hamas are poor and muslim and so are seen as natives.

Older left wing people tend to be more practical, but social media has mostly young people who tend to see through those lenses. 

The right is fairly tolerant for people who go with the plan, and doesn't care about ideological purity- they elected Trump, and he was anti gun, pro abortion, and had a bunch of divorces in the past.

What Israel did in shutting off power and water to Gaza, as well as denying entry of humanitarian aid was revolting and unjustified and a war crime.

Hamas' attitude towards Israel precludes peace.

Likkud's attitude toward Palestine precludes peace.

Hamas' demographic situation drives continuing conflict.

Israel's Haredi demographic situation drives continuing conflict.

Iran, Turkey, Russia, and Qatar's political, financial and military support of Hamas give Hamas reason to not sue for peace.

US, Germany, France, and the UK's political, financial, and military support of Israel gives Israel reason to not sue for peace.

Israel and Palestinian civilians alike are suffering under regimes that are both unilaterally acting to continue conflict at this point in time (this wasn't always true, but the last true peace broker in power in Israel was Sharon).  Israel and Palestinians alike are being killed as political powers outside of their control make decisions to continue fighting.

I honestly think that Israel's government is far less bad than Hamas' leadership. But that doesn't mean their hands are clean or that they aren't fueling the fires of conflict.

There's no one here who deserves unwavering support besides the innocent people on both sides of this mess.

If someone can't say that they support Israelis without supporting Likkud and they support Palestinians without supporting Hamas, I honestly don't think they have anything to add to the conversation.

Within that context, we can talk about if Israel's military response is justified or not. We can talk about if Gaza is occupied or not.  We can talk about if Hamas are freedom fighters or terrorists. There's still plenty to argue about.

My issue has always been with the blanket support of the Israeli government/military from US leaders, no matter their actions in Gaza. The occupation, blockades, pogroms, bulldozing of Palestinian homes to further expand Israeli settlements, and so forth. It has always been untenable, and as such things tend to do, has only escalated over time. 

I support innocent civilians on both sides. I am not a supporter of leaders of either. The attack by Hamas was horrific, and Israel's response, from white phosphorus in Lebanon to the relentless bombing to rubble of Gaza, slaughtering entire families of desperately poor civilians attempting to comply with an insane evacuation deadline, is equally so. To date, 1400 Israelis were killed, and nearly 3000 Palestinians were killed in retaliation, with 10,000 wounded, and a ground offensive coming. Israel is not targeting Hamas, which would be appropriate, but retaliating against civilians. When will it be enough? We clearly declare Hamas to be a terrorist organization, but call Israel an ally, to the tune of over $250 billion in combined aid.

This conflict has been widely studied in search for causation, influences, and potential solutions.

IMHO, students and others can get caught up in influences and causation as justifications.

The problem is religion, as there's no room for mitigation.

Islam also has some very intense stances on what to do to non-believers or infidels. Islamic leadership has ruined just about every state they've taken over going back thousands of years. You could say the same about any state run by religious doctrine.

Hamas taking over Palestine leaves no peaceful resolution.

Has Israel sown seeds of violence? Sure. But that's no justification. And they also have many Muslims living good lives in Israel, free of persecution. So they've shown good will towards peace as well as the bad.

Could Israel have done better? Of course.

The Liberal values of honoring diversity of people and ideas has resulted in a false equivalency between Christianity and Islam, which, ironically, actually dishonors the rights of women, children, LGBTQ and other vulnerable people who suffer every day in the Muslim world directly as a result of Islam.

5035,"Here's the truth nobody wants to tell you. Anti-Semitism? It's a left wing ideology.

We can see this with the most prolific examples of Anti-Semites, like Hitler & Stalin. Despite many thinking Hitler was ""Right-Wing"" he was a prolific socialist who believed in worker unions. He sympathised with Muslims, wished Germany was Muslim and hated ""Conservative"" ideologies like Christianity, Capitalism and Tradition. This came from his homelessness in the capitalist democratic Weimar Republic, in which he grew a deep hatred for right-wing ideologies that he believed gave rise to ""Jewish power."" During the NatSoc movement, the Nazi's made it a clear point that they weren't running for the Catholics with traditional views, hence why the Catholic regions did NOT vote for the Nazis.

As for Stalin? I don't need to go into why he was left-wing, he was a communist opposed to the Western World and banned any semblance of Capitalism or Traditional views... and guess what? He also led a genocide against the Jews in Ukraine.

Western examples come from the fact the Democratic Party used to support the KKK. The UK's Labour Party was ran by Jeremy Corbyn, a known antisemite, all progressive movements like BLM support Hamas...

If you look at the world now, who's supporting Jewish people the most? Conservatives, Right-Wingers and Traditionalists. Who's against them? The leftists.

This can get downvoted into oblivion for all I care - but these are the facts, and as somebody who's studied Anti-Semitism and hundreds of ideologies and philosophies, antisemitism always seems to occur in the left-wing beliefs with only a handful of right-wing beliefs being antisemitic, ones which are not very popular, in stark contrast however, antisemitism is a prolific and accepted thing among the leftist thought process for the most part.",2023-10-16 21:22:58

Many of the people injured during this protest in such a way that left them without limbs. It is uncommon to see Palestinians without legs or arms. 

Why do people who support Israel downplay what the IDF have done? Zionists should denounce the IDF. Just because they wear uniforms doesn’t mean they are any better Hamas. 

If you argue that Hamas was elected, you must also agree that Israel is a democracy, which means the population chose leaders who do things like this and support the oppression of Palestinians. The Israeli people are in favor of the blockade and concentration of Palestinians. They voted for the government who have killed thousands in the past week. They voted for depriving the people who shut of essential things like electricity and water to the people of Gaza.

5045,"To delve into a discussion about Hamas, it's crucial to first comprehend the context of Gaza:
1.	Refugee Population: Approximately 70% of Gaza's residents are either refugees or descendants of those displaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which led to the establishment of Israel. This conflict saw around 750,000 Palestinians forced from their homes, with some finding refuge in Gaza.
2.	Youth Majority: A staggering 50% of Gaza's population is made up of children, and 45% are 14 years old or younger.
3.	Densely Populated: Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas globally, surpassing even Tokyo. The region's dimensions are a mere 5 miles in width and 25 miles in length, shorter than a marathon.

Since 2006, Israel has imposed a harsh blockade on Gaza, effectively isolating it from the world. Except for rare exceptions, no one can enter or exit Gaza. The militants who breached the gates of Gaza this week, most of those people if not all have NEVER seen anything in their lives beyond the confines of this 5x25-mile strip.

Some may question why Palestinians in Gaza don't resort to peaceful protests instead of taking up arms. In reality, Gaza has witnessed numerous peaceful demonstrations that received minimal media coverage and international support. The most recent peaceful marches took place between 2018 and 2019, during which the Israeli military's response resulted in the deaths and injuries of over 36,000 Palestinians, including paramedics, journalists, and children. While these attacks were condemned by the UN, no substantive action was taken against Israel.

In 2014, Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who regularly visits war zones, declared after his visit to Gaza, ""I've never seen such massive destruction ever before."" It's not an exaggeration to say that Gaza is akin to a modern-day concentration camp. Historical heroes who we honor today include those who resisted oppression, such as the Jewish armed resistance in Germany and the slaves who fought their oppressors.

The conflict and occupation of Palestinian territory existed long before Hamas's establishment and its rise to government in 2006. While the killing of innocent people cannot be condoned, it's also difficult to condemn the resistance of a population that has spent their entire lives in an open-air prison. My hope will always be towards a peaceful resolution with two-states, but this choice is not in the hands of the oppressed Palestinians; Israel possesses that decision-making power.

it's worth leaving a thin defensive strata in the south to prop up settlements in the west bank. this has all been accounted for — israel knows it will incur losses and is happy with that devil's bargain so long as they exact much more misery on palestine and continue this status quo they're quite comfortable with.

If you look at the issue from that point of view you cannot equate a terrorist organization with a nuclear powered country that receives more financial aid and weapons from the U.S. than any other country in the world.

Furthermore, Hamas' foundation was supported by Israel. Don't believe me? Look it up. Israel military has admitted it.

 They supported Hamas' founding to combat the PLO which eventually turned into the PA and now does nothing to defend Palestinian rights.

In the current war, Hamas committed war crimes with hang gliders.

Then Israel commit war crimes with state of the art weapons, two huge U.S. aircraft carriers backing them up, had all their munitions restored by the U.S. and are not being condemned by the western world for their ongoing war crimes, some of which include turning off water and power to 2 million civilians, half of which are children. I'm talking about turning off power to incubators in the hospital so babies die. Western news 🦗🦗🦗🦗🦗

This is all after in 2019, 1 million people I'm Gaza peacefully protested for their rights and freedom and the Israeli army just shot the unarmed protesters, live on western Media and the world did nothing.

Do you think the Left is down playing it still? What they are doing is not equating a hand gliding terrorist organization with top 10 army in the world.

Lastly, that top 10 army in the world known as Israel has been in violation of international law for over 50 years. Every time the UN tries to do something about it, the U.S. vetoes the vote. Look it up. It is laughable

By definition, it's the technique or practice of responding to an accusation or difficult question by making a counteraccusation or raising a different issue. It's deflecting and disinformation. 

It's a form of self-deception to deflect the actions of oneself and focus the conversation to the actions of others, changing the topic. It's also a way for self-defense from the accusations of heinous crimes. 

Propaganda is ridden in this sub. I suggest people don't engage too much with:

1. Users who never answer your question sincerely, but return them with more questions.

2. Users who reply a comment with just a link of a gory content. Nothing else, just a link. Maybe calling it online terrorism is too much, but it's a way to provoke you. 

3. Users who, bypassing the story, start nitpicking details. For example, 1000 died, but they will argue about what kind of weapon used to kill those 1000 people. 

4. Users who flat out deny any kind of evidence given without giving reasons they think the evidence is fake.

The reality is there’s no going back in time but a solution forward must come from somewhere. Where? That’s the point of the situation today.  Who on both sides has the courage to create a situation in which both sides must be willing to compromise and accept a viable solution?

The problem is not that Palestinians don’t want peace, they want the right of return or just compensation, 1967 borders, and right to freedom from oppression and occupation. 

As an American Palestinian, I experienced first hand the kindness of the people of Israel during last visit years ago. At the same time, I also witnessed and experienced the tension and racism towards Palestinians in the Jerusalem area. 

The restrictions at the check points, the separation wall, the lack of communication between people, and unfortunately there is mistrust among Palestinian society towards Israel. And the Zionist ideology is rooted in having a single race within the country. The nations law is an example of how racism is a factor that’s driving a wedge between them. 

The occupation is not helping, the settlement activity is counter productive, the recent increase in violence from settlers towards the Palestinians with the support of the army, police, and politicians has increased the distrust between Israel and Palestinians. I could go on and on but I’m looking from the perspective of living in America. I’m sure the people of Palestine have been through different experiences compared to me being a visitor. 

End the occupation as a start, create a viable and secure safe environment for the people including Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel.

- Israeli settlements in the West Bank are clearly unsustainable and agains International law: check ✅
- Israeli politics in the last decades has harshened its stances on the occupation of the West Bank and deliberately ignored Gaza, nurturing resentment in the Arab population: check ✅
- Israel Is not a legitimate State: Absolute uncheck ❌ (for those Who still doubt It). its occupation of Palestine Is, not its simple existence, the majority of the International community recognises Israel as a sovereign State and there Is a UN resolution to aknowledge this.

That Said, we can't still hold on to the same unproductive arguments (from both sides: Israeli's arguments on the occupation of Palestine being its threat perceptions of Arab countries and the remembrance of the Holocaust are not sustainable anymore, things have - luckily- changed since 1948 and Israel too needs to question some of the elements of its contemporary National identity, or the International public opinion would still not accept its right to exist. Of course the International public opinion needs to wash away its widespread sentiments of anti-Jewish prejudice in order to do so, but this Is still another issue). 

But this argument Is also, and especially, worth in the case of Free Palestine: innovative and constructive answers and ideas on how to overcome the conflict between the two populations Is needed, otherwise a permanent hate spiral on the subject Will Always exist. 
About the perception of threat by the Arab countries on the Israeli part, what I'm saying Is that the only Middle Eastern country Which seems to constitute a concrete threat to Israel's safety (net of widespread anti-semitism in the MENA countries, Which Is still Is a serious matter to be dealt with) Is Iran.

Absent a nuclear exchange, the Israelis will be displaced if Iran attacks through all fronts (Jordan, Lebanon and Syria join up or something similar). Hamas by itself would not be able to do this. If the war cannot be contained in this scenario, both Israel and Palestine/Gaza/West Bank would have their boundaries redrawn.

It may be hard for Palestinians to answer this question when you’re asking them about the rights of the same people that have been ethnically cleansing them, chased them out of their homes, segregated them from the rest of the community and displaced millions of their people to now live in refugee camps. That’s of course besides them controlling their food, electricity, water and so on. So do keep this in mind, when you’re worried about the people that’s doing this, rather than the people to whom it’s being done to. 

Also keep this in mind when you’re asking about the people being held hostage, when thousands of Palestinians have been wrongfully imprisoned and tortured throughout decades, and are now being asked “but what about the poor Israelis?” 

To me, and I’m sorry to say this, it just seems like you’re asking the wrong questions and it’s being asked from a very privileged and white supremacist point of view, without you maybe even realizing it. 

Why would Palestinians be worried about where Israelis are supposed to go, when they’re not allowed to go anywhere without permission from the Israeli government or to even come back? Why would Palestinians be worried about Israeli hostages when they’ve been held hostage in an open air concentration/extermination camp for 15+ years?

A Secular state where everyone is safe and equal human, Palestinians are not asking for more than that, the radicals (Hamas) are a result of the far-right parties in Israel that call for the total annihilation of Arabs. Once we manage to lower the voice of both, we can have the desired state. There are 2 million Arabs living in Israel as citizens, did they join Hamas? No, because they are kind of equal citizens, is Israel brave enough to accept the Palestinians' right to live in a state with equal rights? No  
And that's why all this happened  


About hostages: it is a terrible and totally condemned act to take children and the elderly as hostages. and They must be released as soon as possible but not by ethnically cleansing the region, Now I got a question: is it okay to take children as prisoners? without accusation? and shoot them in the genitalia ?

Anyway for me both of them are victim. It is planned by Hamas, run by Iran. Trying to avoid Egypt and Israel working together for their economy.

5144,"To answer your questions with my own opinions, which are definitely very different from what most people would say but I think are more practical: Preserving the lives of the Palestinians is more important than trying to restore territory.

Israel should once and for all incorporate the Palestinian territories into Israel to create a blended state. Palestinians would then have a pathway to citizenship, though it would likely be difficult. In the meantime, Palestinians would be allowed to remain in the country as non citizen permanent residents enjoying the protections of Israeli law but having no right to vote and probably other limitations to rights reserved for citizens. Neighboring countries, those who previously controlled the current Palestinian territories, would be required to repatriate any Palestinians who wish to go to those countries. This would all involve intense scrutiny of backgrounds, of course, to ensure all members of terrorist groups are found and arrested. 

Would this be easy? Of course not. But it can be done. It was done in the United States after the Civil War. We called it reconstruction, where slaves were freed and the Confederacy was reabsorbed into the US. Bitter enemies who had fought for years, along with people who were previously legally less than human were all joined as one, integrated into a blended society. And while it took far too long to get it all working and it's still far from perfect we do for the most part get along with each other. And given the number of people in the present situation is much smaller I absolutely believe it's possible with time and hard work.

The people being held hostage should be released immediately. Hamas is well aware that they have nothing to gain by keeping them and as for citizens of countries like the US they know their governments will not negotiate. At a minimum, hostages should be handed over to the Palestinian Authority, who by virtue of being a recognized government could either negotiate with the countries or simply release them.

The people killed by IDF in the past? That's a huge part of why this war is happening. Hamas created a political branch (much like the Irish Republican Army created the Sinn Fein party) to allow them to gain influence within the PA. People in Gaza voted for them in elections because they felt unsafe and felt that Hamas could protect them, as well as because Hamas promised to meet their basic needs in a time when Israel had made it difficult for them to meet those needs themselves. Basically they chose one bad guy to protect them from the other bad guy.

As a result of Hamas taking power, Gaza was further sealed off from the world. With the destruction of their only airport by the IDF and a land and naval blockade, Gaza became even more destitute and was forced to rely on Hamas more and more. While some in Gaza still genuinely support Hamas many there are afraid of them but feel helpless to take power away from them.

With the severe restrictions on travel, harsh tactics by Israeli forces against their people, many deaths as a result of either military action against civilians or the lack of proper sanitation and medical facilities, and a growing sense of isolation, people became more and more hopeless. There is also obviously great anger toward Israel. All these factors combined led to where things stand today, with Hamas striking back in retaliation to many years of oppression.

Obviously what Hamas did can't be justified in any way. They chose the eye for an eye approach, targeting civilians as revenge for the IDF killing civilians in Gaza. And I truly believe that very few people in the Palestinian territories approve of what was done. It was absolutely disgusting. Just as IDF intentionally bombing hospitals, schools, UN facilities (which are neutral and off limits under international law) is absolutely disgusting. By the time this ends, Israel will have killed another 10-20,000 civilians if they continue on their current course. 

On top of this they refuse to allow food, water, or medical supplies into Gaza. If they were concerned about weapons being smuggled in by the Red Cross/Red Crescent/UN/MSF which is ridiculous, they have the ability to search the shipments or have Egypt do so. But they're just not allowing the shipments in, which means they are going to starve the people in Gaza, resulting in many people simply dying of starvation or dehydration or even of common medical conditions like diabetes.

I take this very seriously as an American because the IDF is using our weapons to kill civilians, which makes us responsible as well. There are always civilian deaths in war, but militaries are expected to take all appropriate measures to avoid unnecessary civilian deaths. This seems like the opposite. Even when the USAF was bombing entire weddings to kill one suspected terrorist, which was also unacceptable, we weren't purposely bombing buildings that we knew were sheltering hundreds of people. We weren't targeting hospitals. We were actually bringing food and medicine into Iraq and Afghanistan as we invaded!

Hostages are always bad. 

In every rhetorical situation, there is an economy of words, leading to non-complex conversation (this is especially true on Twitter). Where the questioner assumes 'Hamas bad', it is then redundant to re-assert 'Hamas bad' and thereby play the rhetorical game of ignoring the fact that the IDF does the same atrocities that Hamas does. For as long as the framing stays firmly on Hamas, the discussion doesn't expand to who the pro-palestinians believe the actual culprits are.

I would like to start by saying that calling it a conflict is incorrect. This term gives the illusion that both sides are on equal footing. When they’re not. Israel is an occupying military power with billions of dollars in foreign aid/funding from Governments and Corporations. Palestine is the occupied country with no military and no foreign aid/funding of any kind.

Now to your questions:

“Where should the Israelis go?”

Many Israelis hold dual citizenship, with Israel being their second citizenship, and hold a residency in their Birth country (ie not Israel). So wherever they were born and hold that residency. Israelis hold citizenship across Europe and America.

“How do you feel about the people being held hostage?”

We feel terrible about the pp being held hostage. It’s not right but they’re being treated humanely (going off of accounts from those who were released) and Hamas had tried to return more hostages but were denied by Israel.

Now for the other two questions. I am not clear if you are asking for those to be answered or if you’re stating them as examples of the deflection. But I will answer them:

“What do you mean? What about the Palestinians that were displaced where should they go?”

Unlike Israelis, Palestinians only have one home land and our families have been there for generations before Israel was a concept in the British Parliament (1918).

Many Palestinians live in refugee camps in Palestine. Literally Refugees in their own country all because Zionist Israelis forcefully evicts Palestinians out of our homes to make room for more Zionists and create Zionist neighbourhoods.

There are still people alive today who were displaced during the Nekba and are being displaced again because of what is happening in Gaza.

“Okay, what about the thousands of people that had been killed by IDF for decades? What about them?”

The death of Palestinians always exceeds the death of Israelis. For example: in 2008, 899 Palestinians (P) were murdered but only 33 Israelis (Is) were murdered; in 2009,it was 1,066 P compared to 11 Is; 2010, 95 P to 8 IS; so on and so forth.

Even in current events for 1 IS death = 10 P dead (Nov 10- death count 12,254 P & 1245 IS).

Not taking into consideration the inequality of death among the two groups over the past several decades is ignorance. I say this bc pp think what is happening now started on Oct 7 when it hasn’t it’s been happening for years. This isn’t even the first time Israel carpet bombed Gaza. It’s just the first time it’s being televised to this extent.

This doesn’t even consider Palestinians who were murdered for political reasons. One of my uncles (mom’s brother) was beheaded for his outspokenness against the Israeli government, for his stance on LGBTQ+ rights (for), the oppression (against), and some  other issues.

At one point Palestinians were even being killed for holding the flag of Palestine. This is why watermelon is a symbol of freedom and resistance for Palestinians. Not just bc Palestine was world famous for our sweet watermelons but also bc it has the red, black, white, & green of our flag. This is why many pp use 🍉 when speaking about/ showing support for Palestine.

To give more context of slogans. Israel is spreading misinformation about “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as a dog whistle to kill all Jews. This is incorrect. It calls for the liberation of Palestinians from West Bank (by the Jordan river) to Gaza (the Mediterranean sea).

“Free Palestine” again just means to liberate Palestine from the occupation and oppression of Zionist Israel.

Just recently they told Palestinian civilians living in the North of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to the South for a pending invasion. Israel is going to carpet bomb the North and invade with troops. I guarantee that for every civilian that was killed in the attack by Hamas, 10 more in the Gaza Strip are going to be killed from the air by Israel. The difference is that they aren't physically going in and brutalizing communities with their hands. Instead, they are sitting back in their comfy Western jets, pushing a button, and erasing a whole housing complex of people. The obvious motivation for retaliation from Hamas militants is that 2.2 million people are being condensed into a continuously shrinking, small box of land. Another example is Israel even trying to colonize the West Bank. Despite many West Bank politicians being very friendly to Israel, Netanyahu is ignoring and shutting them out. Instead, Israel chooses the route of siphoning water and electricity from civilians, and kicking people out of their homes and moving in. This is comparable to how the US continually condensed Native American land until there was barely anything left. The killing of civilians by Hamas militants and by Israel is disgusting, but you can't just simplify it to black and white, terrorists and security forces, or good and bad.

I think the reason why ""Free Palestine"" people cannot answer anything, is because it seems so obvious to them. They overlook the fact that the person asked the question from his own lack of knowledge, knowledge of things that seem obvious to Palestinians.

 As for the answers:

Q. Where should the Israelis go?

A. To where they came from. 

 They could have lived peacefully with the Palestinians, but they have made it more obvious over the years that peace is not one of their objectives.

 About 1 million Israelis have dual citezenship. Which means that they have more than one nationality, one of which is their original nationality passed down from their parents.  
 
 For clarification, there were about 500,000 jews in Palestine during 1948, which was the year when the jews entered Palestine.
 
 These Jews were kicked from their homes in their countries and were warmly welcomed in Palestine, but they were cowardly waiting for the Palestinians to turn their backs. They stabbed the Palestinians in the back. There is irrefutable evidence for that as well. Interviews with actual jews, old jews.  

 Nowadays, however, all of Europe seems to support the jews and sympathize with them, ironic. Europe are the ones who caused this, and instead of providing asylum for the jews, Europe throws the jews to the arabs.

 Now, they are going to get kicked again. Where ever they go, they cause trouble. No one likes them. Maybe that was the reason for the holocaust, but thats another topic.

 

Q. How do you feel about the people taken hostage?

A. Free trip to Gaza! ~~Absolute win!~~ Wait, that's not good..(they will be blown up)
 
 They are treated with the utmost respect. The epitome of muslim manners is shown to them. It is called mercy. [Proof](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNj9qtjM/)? [Proof](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNj9maN1/)?! [Proof](https://youtu.be/rD7NI0tGbp8?si=gL0IRsVp_Vr_6owM)?!?!?

 Israel lied, they will do it again. This is a media war. Just as the Russia-Ukraine war gave rise to drone based combat, this war gave rise to media manipulation.
Many celebritities supporting Israel expressed that by, unknowingly, using images of Palestinians. They thought the images were of Israelis. Such [posts](https://twitter.com/SaeedDiCaprio/status/1712174510076522508) were later deleted.

5161,">How do you feel about the people held hostage”

>“okay um what about the thousands of people that have been killed by IDF for decades. What about that?”

I think a lot of it has to do with them basically protesting the one sided questions being asked.  It's like for instance, if at a Fox News debate, the presenters only kept asking Biden questions about his failures, while constantly asking Trump about his successes.  At some point if you just answer their questions straight, you are playing right into their goal of making you look bad.  It doesn't matter how well you answer the questions, if debate questions are 100% about Biden's failures and Trump's successes, and you answer them honestly without changing the subject,  Trump is going to win the debate.

People on pro-Israel side, which is much of the MSM in America, will generally ask questions that if answered honestly, will make Palestinians look bad.  And when Israelis are on, they get asked fluff questions.  I am not saying this is how it always is, I've seen some Israelis get asked somewhat tough questions by CNN, but there's no tough follow up or pushback, unlike if there is a Palestinian supporter on.

I also don't have a dog in this fight.  But that's why... if you watch a more pro Palestinian news channel like Al Jazeera, you won't see as much deflection, because you won't see them asked questions that make them look bad... but you will see Israelis deflect, because they're asked more questions that make them look bad.

It's panopticon.  If all the news you listen to ask questions that inherently put Palestinians in a bad light, you're going to think Palestinians deflect a lot.  If the news you listen to ask questions that inherently put Israelis in a bad light, you're going to think Israelis deflect a lot.

Also, Palestinians don't agree on what the path forward should be, so there's no one answer everyone agrees on.  So, rather than answering a question definitively in a way that may divide the movement, they focus on things they agree on... sort of like how Israel is now in a war time government, and despite massive disagreements, they've put them all aside and only focus on the things they agree on... because that's what you have to do in hard times.",2023-10-14 11:07:32

Bibi is an idiot and he's done a bunch of bad things that directly come into the current situation

* fighting with the security services which definitely could have lead to the current intelligence failure
* the border appears to have been completely devoid of defenses with only a few hundred soldiers because he sent the rest to protect settlements
* targeting the university in Gaza for destruction rather than capture and other recent targeting decisions which look escalatory
* his long term strategy of pushing down the PLO by working more with their more fanatical buddies

I believe it will turn out that Bibi was at least negligent and is now, knowingly, going beyond what most Israelis would want if they could get to a moment of peaceful reflection (maybe twenty years from now). Bibi is elected but that doesn't mean all Israelis are responsible for his actions. Israelis have a right to self defense, even if Bibi somehow broke the law to make them use it. *Just as not all Palestinians are Hamas, not all Israelis are their government.*

A very specific thing is that [Bibi's settler friends are apparently already taking advantage of the situation](https://archive.ph/9jEbX). The secular Israelis like those at a dance festival or in the Kibbutzes suffer because Hamas specifically targets them whilst the fanatics are profiting. That's not an accident - the fanatics everywhere see their common cause against decent moderation.

A question I'd ask you is ""will you condemn Netanyahu now?"". I'm not even going to ask you to do that because, it's directly a time of war and he's the war leader. You personally might be able to but lots of other Israelis would feel that it's the wrong time. Justice and condemnation can wait till people are actually safe.

That means that, for the future, its absolutely crucial that everyone recognizes the separation between civilians and government. Between criminals and those that live next to them.

""When asked what has been the most positive or the best thing that has happened to the Palestinian 
people since the Nakba, the largest percentage (24%) [38% in Gaza] said that it was the establishment of Islamic 
movements, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad and their participation in armed struggle; 21% said 
that it was the eruption of the first and second intifada; 18% said the establishment of the PLO;
14% said the establishment of the PA in the mid-nineties, and 9% said it was the establishment of Fateh in the sixties and the launch of the armed struggle.

...

If new presidential elections were held today and only two were nominated, Mahmoud Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh [the leader of Hamas], only 46% would participate and from among those, Abbas would receive 33% and Haniyeh 56% of the votes (compared to 52% for Haniyeh and 36% for Abbas three months ago). In the Gaza Strip, Abbas receives 30% of the votes and Haniyeh receives 65%. In the West Bank, Abbas receives 37% and Haniyeh 47%.

...

In an open-ended question, where no names were provided to respondents, we asked the public to 
select a successor to president Abbas. The largest percentage (27%) selected Marwan Barghouti [a leader in the 1st and 2nd Intifadas], 16% went to Haniyyeh, followed by Shtayyeh and Mohammad Dahlan (4% each), Khalid Mishal and Yahya al Sinwar (3% each), Hussein al Shaykh (2%), and 1% selected Mustafa Barghouti.""

And all of the misinformation on the murder of civilians has mostly been false, although, yes there is definitely death, but the rumors of the beheading of babies, children in cages, and most of the people in the festival murdered in cold blood is untrue. The children in cages were a video of Palestinian children in cages. The beheading of children was a lie as per the Israeli government. The murder of people at the festival, while it did happen, didn't happen out of cruelty. They were unfortunately caught in the crossfire between armed forces of both sides. You have my condolences for the civilian death, but not any regret for my people's resistance.

1 - There's a general feeling, among the Palestine supporters, that all this ""mess"" is the consequence of colonial meddling of the UK on the Palestinian side of history (UK didn't want to leave too much territory to France, see Lebanon, too close to Suez canal, which was super important), and post-colonial meddling of the USA (with all the post-WW2 guilt-trips you can imagine) on the Israeli side of the history. So in some ways this is ""the west's fault"" (and Israel is also considered western for this exercise), at least as seen by some people in the west.

2 - A general love for ""the underdog"", and Palestine happens to be one (or successfully position oneself as one), especially when compared to Israel. The sheer firepower and military might make it so that Israel is overwhelmingly stronger than Palestine. And that comes at a cost, that you'll be perceived as the neighborhood ""bully"".

3 - That and, well, decades of pro-Palestinian narrative by the NGOs working there, leveraging on this narrative for fundraising purposes, nothing less, nothing more. Israel has no NGOs speaking for them. People like ""needy"", because it makes them feel better about themselves to stand up for those ""in need"", regardless of who's right or wrong. Palestine's story, simply, is more compelling for whatever reason.

4 - No small amount of antisemitism, corroborated by the fact that, in my opinion, Israel does actively nothing to be liked or likable.

In short, to answer your titular question, ""Poor Arabs bullied into a corner fighting to defend my homeland from the colonial invader"" sells more than ""Jews fighting against terrorists with the Iron Dome and anti-missile lasers"". And Hamas is associated (rightfully or wrongly so) to the first portion of the narrative. Israel to the other side.

But it shows support, it's a call for neighbor countries to start a bigger war, it means ”we will support you, we will do anything to help you if there starts a bigger war”. That was Hamas´s leader actually want, basing on the last interview.

But considering there has been almost a century of Israel's absolute disregard for international law, occupying lands that don't belong to them, encouraging settlers to exercise their wildest, most inhumane desires on Palestinian lands, taking people away from their homes, considering them less than human, projecting a vision of a new Middle East without Palestine, aiming to control Palestinian oil, torturing Palestinians, kidnapping and detaining innocent Palestinian children, asking for billions of dollars from the United States with the objective of carrying out a genocide on Palestinians, equating them all to terrorists, disrespecting their culture, and proposing peace solutions where they don't have the same rights as Israelis, and having one country back them up as a reason for the total failure of international politics...

5363,"This is a very nuanced conversation, and I totally agree that it feels like so many horrific things are happening with little being done. I belief you have some very strong points. 

As an answer to your comment on why certain events have not been spoken about (or given media attention) we must first recognize who has created the narrative - the winners. Americans are seen as the good guys because of the victory against the Nazi’s, and so all of their mistakes have been ‘forgotten’. Further, media during that time was no where as strong or as developed as it was now. 

The reason it seems like there is a lot of pressure being put on Israel is because reporters can only really contact them at the moment (no one can walk to up to Hamas, or bring some of the people apart of the organization into an interview). But again, there is a lot of pressure being put on Hamas, and not just through the news. While Israel is receiving little pressure through the news, Hamas is receiving the pressure of bombs (most of them missing target to hit civilians). I have personally been to many protests over the past few weeks and there have been many posters created asking Hamas to stop. There are also hundreds of Jewish people who come to the protests - most of them attending more than I have.

Further, one of the reasons for strong west support for Israel is due to History. Jewish people have faced horrific crimes in the past, especially during World War 2. Since then, there has always been immense sympathy (rightfully so) for them. But with the changing times and circumstances it is difficult to look at the situation without immediately being wary of not siding with Israel (Jews). Without educating yourself through hard facts (not the media, instead using UN - a third party - reports) it’s easy to go in this direction. Further, when viewing Palestine as a Muslim country, people are often taken back to 9/11, and take a pessimistic stance.

If you are able to put past biases aside and create an opinion reading official UN reports, and not those tainted by both sides of the conflict, then you are a wise and intellectual individual. I applaud anyone who has read this all the way through, even when they realize I support Palestine; it shows an open mind.",2023-11-12 11:15:59
5364,"Only other Muslim nations in the Middle East can ask anything of Hamas. Hamas answers only to the people who fund them. No one else has leverage.

As for Americans being the ""good guys,"" well, we know we've done very bad things and we struggle with that. That's what Biden was trying to warn Israel about: don't make our mistakes. It goes way beyond Iraq. There are dark things in our past. We successfully committed genocide by obliterating most Native American tribes. (There's a reason so many of our horror stories involve demons being unleashed by violations of Native American sacred land). Just as bad has been our history of slavery and segregation. That's something we didn't get away with, and we're going to pay for it, in one way or another, for as long as we exist.

You don't want to be like us in that way. It may be hard to believe, but some of the concern Americans have felt over the war really does come our wish not to have Israel walk in our shoes.",2023-11-11 22:19:10

As we write, there are settlers somewhere in the West Bank harassing, terrorising and stealing Palestinian land. So, do you  see what happens when you put down your arms against Israel?

Gaza was freed by the resistance, Lebanon was freed by Hizbullah, the 1973 war freed Sinai from Israeli occupation (even though Anwar offered to do this peacefully without a war but Golda Meir rejected it).

For me these hours when she was there were hell, I understood she’s in danger around 8:30 we talked on the phone while she was sitting in the car escaping. Later she asked not to call again but only text her. She told me she is surrounded by terrorists and I couldn’t believe it.  I told her to stay as silent they could. I asked for their location. She said a toilet in Be’eri.
Her phone had 1% and luckily I told her to tell her friend to call me so I’ll have his phone. 
Meanwhile I’m crying hysterically and praying that she is alive, they don’t answer for one hour, I continue to tell myself “she’s alive she’s alive she’s alive “ I call everyone I know and tell them about the situation, I find a contact in the army, my father finds a contact in the news and we try to understand their location. 
then they text me “where is the army?” I’m asking for more details, they tell me about the injured and about the building, they say they are shooting nonstop outside and that their police contact they had is not answering anymore.
And again every time I loose touch for around 40minutes to one hour, so I’m looking at the clock nonstop. 
Meanwhile I’m going to bomb shelter because we have sirens and I cry non stop, can’t stop the tears and the terrible feeling. And I find myself just sitting outside when there is no siren smoking cigarettes and calling again and again to everyone I can who can help, even an old friend from high school who has a contact in the army, she tells me they dont answer.

Then I get a call from dors mother, and from his friend, and then a soldier who asks me a bit info and tells me - we are on the way to get them out of there and since then they keep updating me.

She was blessed to be there when Hamas was not as active as they have been at other times. I actually met my ex-husband on a trip to Israel. As part of our tour, we were taken to the area where the UN had established a peaceful zone between Israel and Lebanon in 1978. We later were told that the Lebanese still had border patrols in the area and chances are that armed soldiers were tracking us that afternoon. Eventually, there would be a war between Israel and Lebanon and now that UN zone is known as the Blue Line.

I went back to Israel while my daughter was there to see it with fresh eyes. We were not able to go to the Dead Sea, a huge tourist attraction, during that trip. The highway from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea was closed due to rumors of possible Palestinian hostility towards Israel in the area that day. We stayed in airBnB's during our 10 day sightseeing, often at the apartments of young professionals who had recently fulfilled the requirement to join the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) when they turned 18. I've housed Israeli Scouts in my St. Louis, MO home. They have an entertainment group that travels throughout the year performing Israeli songs and dances at performances booked at U.S. Synagogues, trying to get Jewish children excited about Israel. Many of the performers are turning 18 during their year in the Scouts Caravan and will return to Israel and immediately transition into their compulsory army service. I remember these young people and wonder how many of today's 18 year olds will survive this war. I think about my daughter and how she came home from her semester abroad with a new understanding of the realities of life in Israel. But she came home. I think about myself and am grateful that Lebanon was tensely coexisting with Israel during my visit. I think back to Yom Kippur 1973 and learning that Egypt and Syria had attacked Israel during the holiest day of the year and feeling stunned. Having grown up when I did, I'm old enough to even recall the 6 Day War of 1967 although at the time, I was too young to have more than a very basic understanding of the conflicts in the middle east and I had learned about those by watching Paul Newman in the movie, Exodus (I still own a copy and periodically rewatch it). I feel emotionally bonded to Israel. I have even thought of making Aliyah - moving to Israel and becoming a citizen - if the political situation in the U.S. gets worse. 

Realistically, I still live on the other side of the world and hear only what the news correspondents report. So while what's going on there is extremely distressing, reading a first hand account like your sister's is devastating. To think of the suffering and the destruction and fear that is overwhelming those living in Israel right now cuts like a knife. I want to do something but I have limited resources. So, I'll be grateful for those who, like your sister, are still alive and I will pray for those who, like your sister, will be forever traumatized by their experience and hope that your sister, her surviving friends and all of the others who will be touched by this war including you and your family can eventually heal. Thank you for sharing what she wrote. I have no doubt it really happened. I hope she gets through the rest of this ugly time without further incidents.",2023-10-09 04:43:40

Every time there's been a chance for actual progress in either the peace process or in the Israel-Arab relations in general, the Palestinians as a whole -- or some substantial subgroup or organization thereof -- launch some terrorist campaign.

You can just look at the overall trends in Israeli politics -- the balance between left, center and right parties -- and plot it against the waves of Palestinian terrorism to see the results.

When Palestinians say ""but the Israelis have a very right-wing coalition the past two decades"", all I have left to say as an Israeli leftist and labour voter is: well yeah, duh, you had a significant part in causing that.

And don't give me crap about how Hamas is also a reaction to Israeli policies -- they had non-peaceful but not-murderous resistance in the late 80s / very early 90s and that was a good impetus for the peace process. They just had to ruin it with suicide bombings and murder campaigns.

To be honest, this outcome seems wildly unlikely in the near term. The surrounding arab nations, out of a sense of islamic/arab/nationalist pride and outrage that jews ""control"" the holy land, and their own ambitions have tried to wipe Israel off the map in 1948/67 and 73. Since then elites/governments of Saudi Arabi, Iran, Qatar,.., etc. have funded Jihadist movements around the world, including Isis, Al-Queda, Islamic Jihad in its various forms, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc. That threaten  Israel and contribute to overall violence and instability supported by non-state actors in the region.

The middle east is a bad neighborhood, it is prevaded by autocratic regiems, religious fundamentalism and intolerance, poorly educated populaces, and massive weath inequality. All of this contributes to the regional unstability. On top of this, the presence of oil makes it the playground of world powers vying for influenc, which probably doesn't help.

There are and always have been many wonderful people in all of these countries, but until arab countries develop as societies with more decentralized and robust power structures, and stronger elements that support civil society---from education to diverse economic development---and dare I say it, a stronger secular base of society or a more modern form of Islam which doesn't enable authoritarianism---the middle east will  be prone to instability and violence. And this is the world that Israel will have to cope with for the forseable future.

The shortcut is, normalizing relations with Israel for economic reasons and doing what is neccessary to keep populist sentiments in check. I think this trend will continue, but I don't think that is exactly the peaceful utopia you were speaking too.

In the long arc of history, I think things will improve but the changes your speaking to are the kind that take place over generations, not years.",2023-10-19 11:13:20

5460,"As a Brit who has lived in the middle east for decades, I recognise the important shift in Arab sentiment on this conflict. 15 years ago, Arabs in the GCC didn't agree on everything  - of course like any huge family, they are not a monolith - but when it came to Palestine, they were more or less of one voice, steadfastly behind the Palestinians. Iran were always more militant in their backing of the Palestinian cause, but there was general uniformity in Arab sentiment. 15 years later, it is fair to say that some countries are a little more fatigued by this conflict than the rest. Certainly, UAE and Bahrain are, and to a more cautious degree, so are Saudi Arabia. The three of them seem at least open to exploring new ways of approaching the conflict, and those ways embrace open engagement with Israel. This matters because now, the Arab world are confronting this Israeli-Palestinian conflict on multiple fronts that all matter to the US, and by extension Israel. This is new. 

However, today, Israel's government is more right-wing than ever, with a leadership that is overtly Trumpian in it's craven and cynically mercenary attitude towards retention of power at any cost. Decrying and weaponising fake news is all par for the course.  In 2019, Netanyahu was indicted on charges of breach of trust, accepting bribes and fraud. His trial began in May 2020, but for one bizarre (sometimes manufactured) reason or other his trial has repeatedly been delayed. 

Netanyahu has been on a relentless quest to dodge due process by variously challenging the supremacy of the supreme court, and pushing a fearful but expansionist agenda that ushered him back to power. This matters in the grand scheme of the conflict because for as long as Israel is ""at war"" as he has now declared, nobody is talking about his criminal indictments. Indeed, it is curious that soon after the October 7 attack by Hamas, the Egyptians irritated Netanyahu by publicly revealing that prior to 10/7, they had warned Israel of intelligence that hinted at an iimminent attack from Hamas. The appearance of a conflict of interest at the PM level in Israel is too great to not demand legitimate, serious inquiry, particularly against a backdrop of evolving Arab attitudes that are open to fresh good faith engagement with Israel. 

The Qataris have not joined the rapproachment bandwagon. At least not in the overt way UAE and Bahrain have. They remain resolutely critical of Israel, whilst maintaining solid covert, back channels that keep critical communication alive. Qatar support the Palestinians in word and deed - according to Reuters, since 2014, Qatar has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on construction projects, and she  ""currently pays $30 million per month in stipends for families, fuel for electricity, and to help pay public sector wages."". So it is not overstating things to say that Qatar is incredibly influential in the context of this conflict and this is amply reflected in the fact that after October 7th, US Secretary of State included Qatar in his emergency whistlestop tour of the region, even though the Qataris have been forthright about blaming Israel for her repeated breaches of internarional law. Needless to say, the Amercans disagree, but perhaps herein lies a clue as to where fresh impetus for peace (talks) might come from. 

Qatar has cultivated and virtually perfected her self assigned role as a global master power broker and diplomatic mediator for peace. Her ability to bridge divides and facilitate communication between warring parties is as unsung as it is effective. What's even more impressive is how she is able to mediate in some theatres, without sacrificing her ability to be forthright in those, or any other arenas. And that fosters universal trust. This is how she enjoys credibility with both the US, and Iran, and  both Russia and Ukraine, and both US and Afghanistan, to name just a few.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict may now have reached a point where only a trusted, influential, honest mediator at the nexus of all stakeholders can bring the protagonists to speak to each other. And it would seem that Qatar are amongst the few ideally placed with  the critical combination of experience, subject matter expertise, gravitas, financial muscle and universal confidence to achieve a ceasefire and persuade Israel and Palestine to a negotiating table.",2023-10-19 09:29:29

I've never seen a Jewish suicide bomber and I've certainly never seen Jewish people cause chaos by planting bombs and shooting innocents. So honestly, I don't get what people's Problem is with Jewish people? 🤔

I know there are some Jewish extremists just like there's extremists in all religions who don't respect Christians and they spit at Christian people. I've seen a few videos circulating like that but personally I've never seen this behaviour in westernised countries.

I don't like war and it's horrible but looking back at the history of the country and the region it feels like this has always been a thing and even going into the 1800s to 1900s occupations, war and strife continued.  


Hamas terrorist attacks Israelis and barely anyone says a peep about that and even on US news it was a flash in the pan and then the retaliation took place and it feels like everyone is on the side of Palestine and Hamas even though 1/3 to 1/2 of Palestine supports Hamas and now discussions for yet another ceasefire and I'm in my 50s and remember how many times this has happened and lead ultimately to nowhere.

5513,"If this entire 75+ year conflict was just about the Arab Palestinians having their own country, none of it makes sense.  If it's instead about using the Arab Palestinians as political pawns to attack Israel, then it all makes sense.  This is evidenced by:

-Egypt, Jordan, and Syria trying to TAKE land in 1948 against Israel.  They had no intentions of creating another Arab state.  They wanted to kill all the Jews and expand

-The rejection of every 2 state solution ever offered (5 that I know of), which would have created peace and given the Arab Palestinians self-determination and prime real estate.  Instead, the offers were not counter-offered, but met with violence along with the ""3 No's"", (No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with Israel)

-The insane amount of financial support from both Iran (the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism), and western humanitarian organizations.  Without a continual struggle against Israel, Iran would have no interest in funding their terrorism, and the west would send less humanitarian support.  Also, weapons manufactures enjoy selling both to the Arab Palestinians AND to Israel (the Iron Dome isn't cheap). There is a huge financial incentive to keep the suffering of the Arab Palestinians ongoing, and no financial incentive for peace",2023-11-06 10:13:44

No it’s because In islam and in the Arab world the Jew can not be independent, the Jew can not be strong he must lower his head and be a good little dhimmi,

What israel did was unshackle the Jew from the slavery of the *real* apartheid of dhimmitude that existed in the Islamic world. And for that they hate Israel 

A dhimmi can not rule they’re own country and especially not in a territory previously controlled by Muslims (ottomans) but Israel succeeded. And for that they will hate Israel until they’re final days.

As you see they don’t hate Jews because of Israel no no they hate Israel because of Jews.

Pakistan is ethnically expelling 1.7 million afghan refugees and the Muslim world does not care, Iran can threaten to expel all of its afghan refugees as well ethnically cleansing the state of five million refugees yet the Muslim world is silent and the liberals of the good ole colleges in america and Europe can not be found caring about these people.

The Arab world hates Jews ,they hated us and forced us to be dhimmis, they can’t accept a strong Jew and especially a strong Jew that defeats them.

This definitely creates the reasonable impression that the world is full of antisemitism, hate, terrorism, racism, Islamophobia, etc - and while that all exists, the way these stories reach you is far from transparent. Try to think about what you’re not seeing, too. Don’t construct your views based on the small fraction of information that makes it to you. 

I’m not saying the things you’re seeing aren’t real, but it’s important to consider all the things you’re not seeing. So much context is stripped from what appears on our screen. 

If you can, try to take a break from social media & exploring consensus in communities like this one. They are not representative of reality.

I am very skeptical that the Israeli army will eliminate HAMAS. On the contrary, it will end up creating more radicalized people with the massacre and destruction that they are carrying out in Gaza.

The problem that is angering people is that Isreal refuses to take any responsibility for the killing of civilians in their eagerness to extract vengence. If they want revenge by numbers 10 to 1, 50 to 1 or even 100 to 1 go and do that, but take your vengence against combatants not civilians and dont try to tell me that they have a choice to leave, leave where? Why? The same reasons Isrealis don't leave Isreal. The only other option is to explain how you justify dozens even hundreds to one killing of civilian lives for civilian lives.

Hamas, itself, would have incentive to bomb the hospital.  Hamas knew that attacking Israel would result in an attempt to rid Gaza of Hamas.  Hamas knew that attacking Israel meant that thousands of Palestinians would be killed, but Hamas did it anyway.

What does that tell you?  That Hamas does not care about life and death the way normal people do.  Hamas took actions against Israel knowing with 100% certainty that Israel would retaliate and that Palestinian children would die as collateral damage.

Hamas wants the elimination of Israel.  The only way they can do this is by turning public opinions against Israel -- for example by bombing a hospital.  (I don't think that anything would cause the US to turn its back on Israel, but this is Hamas' thinking.).",2023-10-17 18:17:12

1. There was a post saying Israel bombed the hospital and killed ""terrorists"" but the post later got deleted because apparently that’s what the person who posted the post thought that’s what happened
2. Then a post made by the official Israeli Arabic Facebook said that because the hospital lacked basic resources they decided to bomb it as a form of merciful euthanasia. (The post was deleted though with no apology for the outrageous statement)
3. As this news spread worldwide, Israel refused to take accountability and instead blamed it on Palestinians themselves. They said that a jihad Palestinian group misfired a rocket. They showed videos from 2022 claiming that these were the videos of the alleged misfire. When they got called out, they retracted their statement.
4. They said that the rocket was launched from a cemetery that practically bordered the hospital and then in another slide they showed a different launch site which was much further away. They also claimed to have intercepted an audio recording by 2 Hamas soldiers, saying that it was a rocket launched by jihadis. The problem is every Arab can tell that that the people speaking are obviously Israeli because of the accent, the dialect, and the way the sentences were formed did not resemble the way they spoke. 

They’re obviously trying to create a fake narrative and fabricate stories as they’ve done many times in the past. To name a few:

Hamas is too stupid to to release the hostages.  If Israel leaves at this point, it will lose all street cred and end up wrecked in that neighborhood.

Israel has not choice but to complete the mission step by step which means pushing the civilians out and exterminating Hamas.  

The only way out I can see is a repeat of what happened to the PLO when it was cornered in Beirut in 1982.  It was negotiated the PLO would be allowed to leave and shipped out to Tunis (I believe).

The problem is that was not the end of it.  The PLO set up shop and planned horrendous terrorist operations from Tunis.   Israel deliberated about attacking the PLO base, delayed but then finally after the murder of some Jews on a yacht off Cypress, Israel launched an airstrike that killed a number of PLO soldiers and some locals.

The United States was pissed off, the UN condemned, etc. etc.  Tunisia retaliated and murdered some local Jews including two children.  Sick bastards.  But everyone got over it and life moved on (except for the dead terrorists and innocent victims) and a message was sent and understood.

Based on the foregoing I don't believe this will be an option.  First, I don't think Israel can allow known Hamas members to survive to fight another day.  In fact, those Hamas leaders in Turkey and Qatar no doubt are constantly watching their back these days.

In essence, it’s a mere game of maximizing profits and minimizing losses on each side. Each side exploits their existing conditions/resources calculates their moves accordingly towards their ends, and all actions are executed more or less according to that. 

But of course, the politicians of a country would use the media and moral justifications to align their citizens towards their ends. In that sense, most, if not all, citizens of a country would essentially believe that their country is good since they think it fights for the same ends as theirs. 

But overall, if both countries don’t see a win-win case given their constraints/goals, etc., and none wants to step back, they’d highly likely converge towards a situation in which only one winner is possible. It’s similar for N countries involved in such game.

At the end, it boils down to how the parties involved in the game adjust their goals/interests regardless of whatever moral justification one comes up with.",2023-10-08 14:45:29

Also, as far as I am informed pretty much all the the global community except for Israel agrees that territory of the West Bank as well as East Jerusalem was never meant to be part of Israel. Only Israel and probably a few allies disagrees. So it is not that disputed.

I think most people would be open to Israel actually annexing the land, but it would have to be through a one state solution. The current model, where they gradually confiscate more and more land and resettle it while driving away the former inhabitants is deeply immoral. This is where the ethnic cleansing accusations come in.

Israel will have to make a decision of whether they want to give up the land or annex it while including its inhabitants in its state. At least if it want to make any claim to being a moral state.

If Jews want to have any hope of thriving in this future State where they are a minority, they will need to start supporting other Arab States in reforming Islam, making Arab culture more liberal, tolerant, and less Jew-hating.

5912,"Not on this sub lol. This sub has become such a trash fire. But if anyone is looking for a nuanced take I’ll give you mine.

It’s often claimed that the Palestinian leadership has rejected multiple 2 state solitons. The missing context is that any research into the proposals quickly reveals that these are “2 states” in name only which would change very litle for the Palestinians and constitute a signing of a humiliating defeat for their autocratic rulers who have put themselves in an impossible corner they can’t get out of. These problems are not specific to any particular 2-state solution, they are fundamental to ALL 2-state solitons. 

The fundamental problem no one wishes to address is that the geography makes 2 states impossible. There is simple not enough space and there is also no way to disentangle the overlapping nature of the communities. There is no way to disentangle the infrastructure on land, there is no way for both states to each have sovereign access to the Mediterranean Sea, and just forget about trying to partition the air space.  

Any peace plan must start from 2 basic recognitions: 1.) no physical separation is possible, 2.) the average person at the end of the day will care about their personal quality of life and freedom of movement, not where the technical lines are drawn on a map. For historical reasons, a single state is unlikely to happen. So what is needed is a union of states situation with open borders between them. The key to peace is to grant all citizens of both states freedom of movement, residency, and employment within the combined territory of both states, and to treat violent incidents as a criminal matter rather than a military matter. What I have in mind is something like the present situation in the European Union and Schengen Zone. 

There is an unending list of failures of both leaderships which we could point to. I won’t in any way directly argue against people who wish to claim that the Palestinians “deserve” more blame in some grand historical sense. I don’t find those discussions productive but if you need to be soothed by claiming to be the side “less at fault” than sure thing I’ll agree with whatever you say on that. But no matter what the historical tally of wrongdoing is, Israel should be held to the higher standard and expected to step up and be the adult, to value Palestinian wellbeing infinitely more than Palestinians are willing to value Israeli wellbeing, because Israel is the far wealthier, far more powerful, and far more democratic society in this dynamic. If supporters of Israel want to say that they should not be held to a higher standard than they are free to do so, I just don’t see why anyone would put a desire to tit for tat revenge over their own dignity. It’s a complement to be held to a higher standard, in case anyone has forgotten.",2023-10-23 12:10:37

Since the recent actions of Hamas, it's no longer likely that a militarily pacifist Israel is possible, which means that the name of the game is creating, enforcing, and following treaties. Since Hamas has an untainted history of breaking ceasefires and not following treaties, this is as far as I can imagine Israel going to the left absent regime change in both Gaza and the West Bank. Something else Israel can do though to incentivize change is to create better accountability for how soldiers treat civilians at borderlands during times of peace (not that IDF misconduct is always unprovoked. It's not.) Staffing borders with more professional individuals as opposed to drunk teenagers and early 20's would be great.

Israel does indeed have a apartheid and a blockade. They have separations all around the country in the form of different roads, separate rules for travel, separate rules for citizenship, all kinds of Separation within the government. They need to fix that problem,But now that they've been attacked again they have no reason to. They're not going to lift a blockade to open their borders to a country that just killed 1,400 people and are holding hostages. Not without disarming Hamas. The way to get the blockade to go down was to do the opposite of what they were doing. Be a good neighbor and you'd be surprised how easily fences come down. It doesn't mean they have to like them they just have to treat people well and don't try to kill them and stuff.

A lot of people assume though that Palestinians are poor because of the blockade. No one is talking about that. They're getting International aid from many countries. If Hamas was not using it for a combination of rockets and billionaire salaries, that money could have been used to give them desalination solar power and reliable satellite internet. But instead most people there are living without dignity and with a lot of rockets and weapons of Destruction. They have not learned to stop doing things that don't work. And they need to clean up their own backyard.

Israel is not committing genocide. In order to commit genocide you have to be able to actually kill a huge number of people to the point where you're eliminating their identity as an ethnic group or religion. Neither of those two things are happening. The population of Palestinians has indeed increased in Gaza and the West Bank. 

They are at War with Gaza but people get killed when you're at War. Hamas was the first to say that they were at War and they were intending to have a long War. They have been firing Rockets ever since they never stopped. People act like they've just been sitting around begging Israelis to stop but they've mostly just been taking to social media to tell everyone that they are being murdered.

I believe the Arab countries have been using the Palestinians in the west bank and gaza as pawns for their own geopolitical purposes.  They do not want a democracy on their back door and enjoy keeping the tensions between Israel and the Palestinians high.  I'm not sure if there can be peace if other Arab countries are unwilling to relinquish their propaganda campaign on the Palestinians.

This cannot be changed overnight. There needs to be an occupational administration and a comprehensive de-terroring campaign, just like with Germans after 1945.

The fact that Palestinians have been victims of apartheid and war crimes has been widely acknowledged outside of ""the Free Palestine movement"". One example: Jimmy Carter. Surely you're not suggesting that this former US president is a puppet of the ""Free Palestine movement""? There is abundant evidence that Palestinians have been oppressed and treated as second-class citizens, with greatly limited human rights.

If non-Palestinians deny (or ignore) these facts, it will be impossible to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Palestinian people. You need to understand WHY the people of Palestine have become sympathetic to Hamas. When people are systematically persecuted and disenfranchised, they become radicalized. Look at gangs in America, or virtually any strongman dictator's rise to power. If you want to support Palestine-without-Hamas, you need to engage menaingfully with the root causes for Hamas's power. It's not enough just to say ""Hamas is evil, Hamas must go"". From the point of view of many Palestinians, Hamas is like the insane rabid guard dog protecting their last freedoms.

And I would disagree that claims of apartheid and genocide are lies perpetuated by the free Palestine movement. These concepts have minimum situational requirements to be labeled as such and those requirements for genocide and apartheid have been met. This is a modern genocide in an apartheid state. 

Lastly- explain your take on the hospital explosion. I’ve watched endless amounts of video and seen nothing that logically supports a rogue rocket and tons of evidence that supports an Israeli air strike. 

And my only input to the nuance of this is that whether is allowed or not and whether it’s comfortable or not- part of the nuance is for Israelis to acknowledge and accept the fact that the nakba took place.

5978,"Your first point is the crux of the issue. Zionism is an idea predicated on mass human displacement. Even prior to the 1948 ethnic cleansing they were still displacing palestinians by buying land and then evicting the tenants. Everyone, the arabs, americans, and the british understood that it was a bad idea, and only supported it when things had gone too far to reverse.

After stealing their land, defeating them in war, and then establishing an apartheid state, you have to expect civil unrest and even terrorism as a result. 

If you look through history there has never been a genuine and sustained effort by Israel to make amends for their crimes. Quite the opposite, the prevailing opinion is that zionism is perfect, and all of the palestinian aggression is happening for no particular reason.

While a two state solution isnt possible while palestinian leadership maintains their stance, significant progress can still be made. For example:

a. A formal apology by Israel for stealing the land.

b. Allow palestinians to travel in and out of gaza and the wb. Freedom of movement.

c. Allow palestinians to become free and equal citizens under the law. Unless a two state solution is enacted, than the government must represent the whole population without distinction.

d. Began a large scale reconstruction project in the westbank.

e. Stop annexing additional land.

Hundreds of groups have been ethnically cleansed from many places in the last 100 years. Even Palestinians in Lebanon and Syria are dying and suffering with no one to speak out for them.

Had Israel been a Muslim state, it'd be the shining beacon of Islamic greatness, and how an incredibly tiny proportion has more noble prize winners per capita than most of the dumb Westerners. Even the great and mighty USA buys weapon technology from a tiny nation like Israel.

The entire Islamic world would probably think that Israel was justified to expel the Palestinians out 75 years ago.

The mass slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust is **not** “the reason”—the only, or the main reason—“Israel exists in the first place.”  That’s a popular talking point among many anti-Israel types who think they’ve uncovered some clever secret; it is not accurate. 

Zionism began in the 1800s, and consolidated under the leadership of Theodore Herzl, who looked around Europe, across geography & history, and saw endless, intractable waves of antisemitic violence & persecution that showed no signs of abating. The Holocaust, you could say, was Herzl’s nightmare/prophecy come to life. 

Certainly, endless Jewish persecution was a large motivator, and if there had been zero such persecution, maybe there would’ve been no Zionism. But there is no upside—and lots of downside—in playing such hypothetical what-if games.

Very short-lived European guilt & shame over the Holocaust was likely conducive to those who voted in favor of Israel at the UN—but that just means that guilt induced these people to do what they should’ve done anyway, on the basis of justice & morality.

Many nations voted for Israel—and promptly allowed it to fight for its life unaided, against overwhelming odds, as five well-armed Arab states attacked it immediately. Israel won by its own will—not “because of the Holocaust.” Of course, the still-smoldering memories of the Shoah motivated the brave Israeli soldiers fighting for Israel the day it was born— many Holocaust survivors were among them.

Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005 and that allowed Hamas to flourish unchecked for 18 years. Meanwhile the West Bank has had small conflicts but no major terrorist organizations planning huge attacks. It makes a pretty good argument for occupying the Gaza again.

Today, Moroccan culture (music, architecture, cuisine, crafting, literature, etc.) is partially jewish, with many other influences from Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

A quick TLDR: it calls for the removal of Israel, and the killing of the Jews there. 

Arabic: من النهر إلى البحر,  min an-nahr ’ilā l-baḥr

The Jordan River (eastern border of Israel) to the Mediterranean Sea (western border of Israel).

In 1948, Sheikh Hassan el-Bana, head of the Moslem Brotherhood, stated that “If the Jewish state becomes a fact, and this is realized by the Arab peoples, they will drive the Jews who live in their midst into the sea.” In 1966, Syrian leader Hafez Al-Assad, insisted in no uncertain terms that, “We shall only accept war and the restoration of the usurped land … to oust you, aggressors, and throw you into the sea for good.”

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said that, “in a final resolution, we would not see the presence of a single Israeli – civilian or soldier – on our lands.” If those lands are ""from the river to the sea"" then clearly they want the entirety of the land Judenrein.

On June 1, 1967, Ahmed Shukairy, then-Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said, “this is a fight for the homeland – it is either us or the Israelis. There is no middle road. The Jews of Palestine will have to leave. We will facilitate their departure to their former homes. Any of the old Palestine Jewish population who survive may stay, but it is my impression that none of them will survive.”

Article seven of the Hamas Charter reads, “the Prophet, Allah’s prayer and peace be upon him, says: “The hour of judgment shall not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them, so that the Jews hide behind trees and stones, and each tree and stone will say: ‘Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him,’ except for the Gharqad tree, for it is the tree of the Jews.”",2023-11-12 13:22:46

6188,"They are calling for the [original agreement between Britain and the Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence) to be honored:

>The McMahon–Hussein Correspondence[a] is a series of letters that were exchanged during World War I in which the Government of the United Kingdom agreed to recognize Arab independence in a large region after the war in exchange for the Sharif of Mecca launching the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire.[2][3] The correspondence had a significant influence on Middle Eastern history during and after the war; a dispute over Palestine continued thereafter.[b]

...

>Damascus Protocol
>On 23 May 1915, Emir Faisal bin Hussein—the third son of Hussein—was presented with the document that became known as the Damascus Protocol. Faisal was in Damascus to resume talks with the Arab secret societies al-Fatat and Al-'Ahd that he had met in March/April; in the interim he had visited Istanbul to confront the Grand Vizier with evidence of an Ottoman plot to depose his father. **The document declared the Arabs would revolt in alliance with the United Kingdom and in return the UK would recognize Arab independence in an area running from the 37th parallel near the Taurus Mountains on the southern border of Turkey, to be bounded in the east by Persia and the Persian Gulf, in the west by the Mediterranean Sea and in the south by the Arabian Sea.**

In the context of Palestine, the sea would mean the Mediterranean Sea and the river is the Jordan River.

Also check out what the [Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Mandates_Commission) from the League of nations [said about this in 1930:](https://books.google.com/books?id=dl9ymi8rKkAC&pg=PA1329&lpg=PA1329&dq=Doubtless+the+Arab+attacks+were+directed+only+against+the+Jews,+but+the+resentment+which+caused+the+Arabs+to+commit+these+excesses+was+ultimately+due+to+political+disappointments+which+they+attributed+to+the+parties+concerned+in+the+mandate,+and+primarily+to+the+British+Government&source=bl&ots=AwVLzQ8qbG&sig=ACfU3U3UQ0XXVDBp2QHClnfTMBAS_KF1ww&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPqPb-34iCAxXYIkQIHUZzCVsQ6AF6BAgIEAM#v=onepage&q=We%20believe%20that%20the%20main%20cause%20of%20the%20disturbances%20which%20have%20led%20to%20continual%20bloodshed%20in%20Palestine%20for%20the%20last%2012%20years%20is%20the%20persistence%20of%20the%20British%20Government%20in%20depriving%20the%20Arabs%20of%20their%20natural%20rights.%20We%20feel%20that%20there%20can%20be%20no%20security%20in%20future%20against%20the%20recurrence%20of%20disturbances%20such%20as%20those%20which%20have%20taken%20place%2C%20or%20perhaps%20of%20an%20even%20more%20serious%20nature%2C%20unless%20the%20British%20Government%20promptly%20and%20radically%20changes%20its%20policies&f=false)

>“We believe that the main cause of the disturbances which have led to continual bloodshed in Palestine for the last 12 years is the persistence of the British Government in depriving the Arabs of their natural rights. We feel that there can be no security in future against the recurrence of disturbances such as those which have taken place, or perhaps of an even more serious nature, unless the British Government promptly and radically changes its policies …”

In 1939, [a British Royal Committee was formed to sort out the original agreements made to the Arabs and said the following in its report:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cmd_5974_Report_of_a_Committee_Set_up_to_Consider_Certain_Correspondence_Between_Sir_Henry_McMahon_and_the_Sharif_of_Mecca_in_1915_and_1916.djvu)

>“In the opinion of the Committee it is, however, evident from these statements that His Majesty’s Government were not free to dispose of Palestine without regard to the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of Palestine, and that these statements must all be taken into account in any attempt to estimate the responsibilities which – upon any interpretation of the correspondence – His Majesty’s Government have incurred towards those inhabitants as a result of the correspondence”.

This is why a two state solution is not satisfactory to many Arabs, because they do not believe Israel as a state should exist in the first place. And it has been escalating ever since because both sides will not back down. IMO Britain should have partitioned their own country into two states if they really wanted to create a nation state for Jewish people. The backlash from that would probably be pretty similar to the Arabs.

[The UN has a good write-up talking about all of this in a report they made in 1978.](https://www.un.org/unispal/history2/origins-and-evolution-of-the-palestine-problem/part-i-1917-1947)
The report ends saying:

>Ironically, the Palestinian Arabs were to suffer an experience similar to the Jews – a diaspora. That the Jews deserved sympathy was unquestionable. Even before the Nazi terror, this sympathy existed for the Jewish people among the Palestinian Arabs. The absence of racial rancour before the Balfour Declaration received emphasis in virtually every official report. Even as late as 1937, during the Palestinian rebellion for independence, the Royal Commission on Palestine said:

>>“An able Arab exponent of the Arab case told us that the Arabs throughout their history have not only been free from anti-Jewish sentiment but have also shown that the spirit of compromise is deeply rooted in their life. **There is no decent-minded person, he said, who would not want to do everything humanly possible to relieve the distress of those persons, provided that it was not at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress on another people.”**

>Arnold J. Toynbee who, before becoming recognized as an eminent world historian had dealt directly with the Palestine Mandate in the British Foreign Office, wrote in 1968:

>>“All through those 30 years, Britain (admitted) into Palestine, year by year, a quota of Jewish immigrants that varied according to the strength of the respective pressures of the Arabs and Jews at the time. These immigrants could not have come in if they had not been shielded by a British chevaux-de-frise. If Palestine had remained under Ottoman Turkish rule, or if it had become an independent Arab state in 1918, Jewish immigrants would never have been admitted into Palestine in large enough numbers to enable them to overwhelm the Palestinian Arabs in this Arab people’s own country. **The reason why the State of Israel exists today and why today 1,500,000 Palestinian Arabs are refugees is that, for 30 years, Jewish immigration was imposed on the Palestinian Arabs by British military power until the immigrants were sufficiently numerous and sufficiently well-armed to be able to fend for themselves with tanks and planes of their own. The tragedy in Palestine is not just a local one; it is a tragedy for the world, because it is an injustice that is a menace to the world’s peace.**”",2023-10-25 22:18:51

I've answered this question a couple of times already so I'm thinking of making one post where everyone could see it. But thanks for your question!

I am not Palestinian so I asked a few of my close Palestinian friends what they hoped to achieve with this chant or what it meant for them, because, I too, wasn't sure. I knew how the other side would misinterpret it so I asked them to clarify. 'From the River to the Sea' is a chant where symbolically, Palestinians are hoping, praying, wishing to be free to explore Palestine literally 'from the river to the sea'. No longer living in refugee tents, no longer having to go through military checkpoints, no longer being separated by a huge ugly war, no longer being separated and made to feel less human at every movement they make. A place where they can move freely, explore the scent and the history of their parents and grandparents land. Its symbolic for them.

6223,"If by your logic “from the river to the sea” is genocide than by the same logic that also means all the land taken from the Palestinian people by the state of Israel so far is also genocide, the settlements on the West Bank genocide too, the Palestinians have been reduced to a mere sliver of their former territory and the State of Israel claims all of it so by the same logic that “from the river to sea” is genocide than the state of Israel has been committing genocide for a long time all ready. Also the Palestinian people are currently facing the same problem you mentioned they have no where to go the neighboring countries aren’t able to support them. Zionist counter these arguments by saying it’s not genocide because Palestinians can become Israeli citizens and be equal with Jewish Israelis, but the truth is Palestinians in Israel are treated as second class citizens but if you make the argument that’s not the case than we can also make the same argument that “from the river to the sea” is not genocide because Israelis and Jews can also be integrated into Palestinian society as equals and not killed off like a genocide would imply. Ideally I would hope for there to be a single secular democratic state for all the Jewish and Palestinian people to live together as equal citizens but I worry that will not work and the Jewish and Palestinians won’t be able to live in peace because of how indoctrinated they are to hate each other by the current states, they would probably take the sides of different political parties and depending on if Palestinians or Jewish people are the democratic majority will decide if Palestinians or Jewish people control the government which would still lead to oppression of either Jewish or Palestinian people.  I don’t believe a two state solution will lead to lasting peace either as that’s basically the current situation we have been trying for a long time and it’s not really working.

What palestinian want is to have their own lands that was taken by force, choose their own government and raise their kids not bury them which is not happening now. If you are a palestinian citizen living in israel you are less than an animal. You can't choose where you live, who you marry. You can't travel. You are a terrorist. You can be killed any time in cold blood.

WHERE WOULD THE JEWS GO?

First, let's agree that the idea of israeli state can't Accommodate arabs (muslims & christians) and jews. It was Founded on the basis of apartheid. It is a jewish state. So the solution is the palestinian state which Accommodate arabs and jews which was the situation before 1948. So we give the palestinians their lands back, the jews who have their real lands (not stealing it) can keep it. The palestinian immigrants and refugees can come back to their home. The jews who don't have lands can go back to where they came from(the jews percentage grows up from 7.6% 1914 to more than 50% now). Most of them have dual citizenship already.

I’m no victim here, my direct family is fine and other than losing some friends on the first day of the war we are all fine. I am though pregnant and the thought of my baby being hated makes me cry to no end. 
But it’s just crying and one day we will get over it somehow. Every post I see has comments of “freepalestine” and with it incredible hate towards us when people don’t even know how we feel, they just hate us, don’t care where we go and wish us dead. I was brought here, no one asked me. I do love this country and I had plenty of Palestinian people who worked with me in different places and I have no clue what happened to them now. I believe in a 2 state solution, I believe in dignity for all. I believe the baby that’s in my belly is as important as any baby in Gaza. I would like to grieve properly…as any other country would be allowed to. 
I’m just allowing myself to speak freely here and I just wish people would know that we are not celebrating people dying in Gaza, we are sad that this is happening, most of us want our prime minister to rot in jail, we are although angry about the massacre and it’s hard to look pass it. Cause as we see it, we didn’t really do anything but exist we didn’t kill anyone, we were brought here and born here and most of us have no other place to call home. We don’t want Gaza, we want it to be a home for Palestinians but a good home, with a government that cares for them, with a flourishing economy, with tourism, being allowed to go in and out.

There are few extremists everywhere who were saying stuff about Ukraine that you mentioned but majority of the people do support Ukraine as well .

Free Palestine for 95% of those that say it is about dignity, justice, fairness, and a future to look forward to for the millions of people under occupation today. I have a ton of Israeli and Jewish friends who think the same, regardless of what phrase they use. Just like the vast majority of Jews aren't interested in Eretz Israel with the Kingdom of Amon and Moab.

Antisemitism is poison. In all of its forms. If being critical of Bibi's Israel is antisemitism, turns out I know a ton of antisemitic Jews of all stripes.

Do you live in the middle east? Everybody was critical of both of these invasions and still are today. In online discourse the invasion of Iraq is especially constantly pointed towards as being a disaster and constantly talked about. I know of a #freeafghanistan but in both of these cases there's no outside power currently holding either Iraq and Afghanistan under some form of occupation. Considering you were complaining about what 'your society' as an Arab is saying in regards to Russia and Ukraine I'm confused as to how you're not aware about this, unless you're in the diaspora which makes your analysis of 'your society' less trustworthy. 

> Then the war on Ukraine happened and as an Arab, people around me in my society and on Facebook we're celebrating screaming that ""it's sinners killing sinners let God take them all""

> What happened to standing with the innocent?

> So it appears that Arabs/ Muslims don't care about the innocent people in Palestine they just care about the land itself because it has religious meaning to them (it is literally connected to the judgment Day in islam, the day Palestine is free is the day of judgment for Muslims)

I wouldn't use generalizing language towards Arabs and Muslims implying they don't care about innocent lives because your Facebook feed is filled with crazies. Above you say you 'know what I'm about to say doesn't include all Arabs / Muslims ' yet you still use generalizing language. Like here:

6334,"I'm a Sunni Muslim and know people in the Syrian, Moroccan, Pakistani, British, Turkish and Saudi communities mainly. From among those people, practically everyone condemns any terrorist attacks of any kind. In particular, every notable religious figure I've interacted with (scholars, Imams etc.) has all been strongly against terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, the killing of civilians and so on. I'm not sure which poll you did or sample of people you questioned but I'm not convinced these people are more than a vocal minority. 

An important thing to remember is the scale of what we're talking about. There are around 2 billion Muslims in the world. If even 10 million of them support these horrible acts, they are still proportionally a vocal minority as they only account for 0.5% of Muslims. 

From the people I know and have interacted with, discussions about the actions of Hamas have been scarce because it is well accepted that civilian casualties are unacceptable in war in Islam. They have, however, been sympathetic towards the Palestinian people for a long time and continue to pray for the innocent civilians that are being harmed now and have been treated unjustly for decades.

The scholars in these communities have, in light of recent events, been reminding people of the times when Muslims ruled Jerusalem and lived in harmony with the Jews and Christians. Reminding people that it is not permissible to change or remove the sites of worship for other religions. That it is not acceptable to forcefully convert people to Islam. That everyone is seen as a potential Muslim and those that revert to Islam are completely free of the sins they may have committed before, no matter how terrible. 

Yes, they have also spoken of the blessings of those sacred lands, and how fundamentally important they are in Islam. This is because the real problem the majority of Muslims currently face is indifference. We aren't out protesting on the streets, or doing anything else for that matter, because our hearts are dead. The reality is that if the majority of Muslims actually stood up in defense of Palestine, we would undoubtedly see a change in the conflict, but that hasn't happened due to our own weakness. The message has always been that we Muslims need to correct our own hearts and become true representatives of our faith if we want to see change. This goes not just for the conflict in Palestine but for everywhere in the world where Muslims face injustice. Be that in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, China, or anywhere else. Ultimately, the fact that people like yourself see us this way is a fault of our own making. Not because we are what you believe, but because we have failed to portray the truth of Islam.

Eh - most people currently in the Middle East could say the same about being native to the region.  Doesn’t mean the Palestinian people should be stateless.

Don’t have an opinion about who did what as pertains to Gaza pre Oct 7.

The major difference is Egypt isn’t bombing Gaza.  But my argument is more that it is disingenuous to say you warn people to leave and then don’t actually let them leave to somewhere you aren’t bombing.

Don’t know if I’d say genocide but the last almost three weeks just one side is taking all the casualties.  Emotionally it feels like a one sided war that is killing civilians instead of combatants.

All hostages must be released.

Murdering 1400 people is no way to bring peace to the region.

Even if Hamas predicted that slaughtering defenseless Israelis would cause Israel to retaliate and Palestinian civilians would die in the crossfire, it is not anti-Semitic to feel a visceral horror to video of dead or gravely injured babies and children being pulled from the rubble every night in the evening news.

The problem is, WAR has no rules, as Hamas has shown, and those who think the opposite often lose.   This was true in the American Revolutionary War where the British would fight in full colors in marching lines only to get mowed down by Americans hiding behind trees.

However, there is also a lot of using antisemitism as a shield to all valid criticisms. There is also a lot of Zionist refusal to accept any criticism of Israel. Zionists and especially the Anti-Defamation League have been running a propaganda campaign for years with the intention to equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism. I have seen tons of Israel supporters claiming any support for Palestinian human rights is sympathizing with terrorists. Advocating for Palestinian rights without, in the same breath, condemning Hamas’ massacre of civilians is somehow antisemitic. 

I am Jewish. I am concerned about the rise in antisemitism globally and by the antisemitic rhetoric that creeps into these movements by people with nefarious intentions. They do not negate the importance of the movement itself, but they make it hard for me, as a Jewish person, to stand with the movement. I was pretty disgusted to see calls for a “free Palestine” immediately on any news coverage of the Hamas massacre and for people with Palestine flags showing up to vigils for dead Israeli civilians. While I understand that humans collectively have a short attention span, and rallying for Palestinian freedom during times when the world is paying attention to the situation in the Middle East is critical, the tactful thing to do would be to give Jews/Israelis a second of space to mourn and grieve. At the very least, not commenting on the initial reports of civilian deaths with “Free Palestine” because I feel that shows a complete disregard for the lives of these civilians and their families. However, it’s also important to note that Israel supports are commenting similarly on videos/news of Palestinian casualties are also guilty of the same lack of tact. It goes both ways and we all need to do better.

I also hope for Palestinians to achieve freedom from Israeli oppression. For the individuals guilty of crimes against humanity (on both sides) to face Justice. For a peaceful resolution. However, realistically that likely looks like a two-state solution just based on the geopolitics. So any calls for the destruction/dissolution of Israel are not helpful and not realistic either. Unless taken by force in war, there will always be a Jewish-majority state in Israel. So, yes, I agree that I am at times disappointed in my fellow progressives and I wish that everyone who felt passionate enough about this to engage in activism actually took the time to study and educate themselves outside of social media infographics. I also think my fellow Jews need to reevaluate the story they were taught at Hebrew day school and re-educate themselves on the situation and stop hiding behind the shield of antisemitism to guard them from any information they dislike or disagree with.

6406,"Some contention to *some* of your points:

* The slogan ""from the the river to the sea"" is not necessarily a call to destroy the State of Israel. Given the fact that the occupied West Bank is along the Jordan River, and the blockaded Gaza territory is along the Mediterranean, one can reasonably argue it's a call for emancipation of current Palestinian territory.

* To say that Israel hasn't occupied Gaza since 2005 is a little misleading. Israel has absolute control over Gazan airspace, coastal waters, the large *majority* of its borders and only access point to the occupied West Bank -- nearly everything that goes in and out. 

* There are clearly legitimate accusations of colonisation towards Jewish-Israeli settlers colonizing the occupied West Bank and East-Jerusalem, evicting Palestinians from their homes, farms and communities to make way for Jewish settlements. Israeli forces in the occupied WB forcing Palestinians to live in heavily restricted enclaves, where they have inadequate access to basic infrastructure such as highways and water. Palestinians in WB are forced to carry special ID papers and use special license plates to differentiate between the Jewish settlers. 

* (The above description of the colonisation of the occupied WB are basic verifiable facts. Nobody is obligated to acknowledge the, to be quite frank, debatable claims of Indigeneity of the mostly European descendants of modern-era Jews in Palestine and the Golan.)

* Two points in one: ""*If you believe that mass causalities caused by a brutal war automatically means it’s a genocide, you might be an antisemite.*"" and ""*If you’ve never called for the release of the hostages that were brazenly kidnapped from Israel and you only care about the pain of those in Gaza, you might be an antisemite.*"" These two points are a little bit contradictory. One can be critical of how retributive the IDF air strikes are on Gazan civilians, especially given that air strikes are not conducive to rescuing said hostages. There has been a lot of criticism, coming from Israelis, on how Bibi and co are doing a very inadequate job on getting the hostages back, and only focusing on violent retribution of Hamas -- with little consideration of the risk posed to Gazan civilians AND the Israeli hostages mixed-up with them.",2023-10-27 17:13:53

Why must anyone who doesn’t agree with Israel policy be described as being in a leftist echo chamber. Not sure about where you live but Orthodox Jews where I live don’t live in integrated communities so I’m wondering what leftist echo chamber they live in when they oppose Israel killings. 
Equalling being against Israel policy with Jews is wild. 
We live in a world where in constantly hatred of the Arab world and Muslims doesn’t stop at palestine. It seeps into the fabric of every single society across the world. And that was way before ‘48. Became much worse in the 90s.

Not all Jewish people are colonizers but there is no denying the Zionist Movement was literally indoctrinated on Colonialism. People are using the term settler just as Theodor Herzl, Jabotinsky, Weizmann, The first Zionist Congress, The Zionist Restoration Fund, The Zionists of America all referred to themselves as colonists and insisted on colonizing Palestine. They put ads in newspapers calling for colonizing Palestine, wrote books (The Iron Wall) published news periodicals yet some how it backs a slur?
 The only one against it was Ahad Ha’Am.

I’ve noticed a case of Denialism going around IMO and it seems that social media’s response is “you’re an antisemite or everything is biased and you hate Jews” whenever you try to criticize or express any information that doesn’t support the narrative. 

Genocide which I believe is happening on both sides is defined as follows “ In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Contrary to popular opinion “but look at Palestine’s population it’s in the millions this isn’t a genocide”
Nowhere in the definition of the crime of genocide is there a numerical qualifier. When smaller groups are the victims of genocide, or when the main means of genocide is other than killing, often public debates are framed around the comparably smaller numbers of deaths. More often than not, those who make the numerical argument, base it on the assumption that “not enough” members of a targeted group have been killed. In itself a rather genocidal argument.

Many Scholars note that settler colonial regimes are structurally prone to genocide, and may indulge in “genocidal moments” when they become frustrated by the resistance of a colonized or occupied people.
This may be why the term “Colonizer” is triggering. 
This has been backed up by the International Criminal Court and the Center for Constitutional Rights. 

Any mention of Ethnic Cleansing also puts you in the dog house. (800,000 Palestinians in 1948 and 400,00 in 1967) , ethnic cleansing of 90% of the land of Palestine and 2 million Palestinian deaths since 1935 from violence. As well as the many attempts to remove Palestinians out of the West Bank and Area C which is where a lot of colonization is taking place. 
The expansion of illegal settlements, denial of permits(2.2% out of 4,422 from 2009-2018 and .6(% from 2019-2020) demolition of homes, destruction of livelihoods and infrastructure, and attacks on civil society organizations is considered ethnic cleansing but usually the argument is to put blame on Hamas for not building any infrastructure.

Palestinians elected Hamas to lead them and have been mostly in control of their own fate since then.  Once that happened they effectively became their own ""country"".  Only a limited number of neighboring countries in the world allow you to freely hop between them.  If I want to travel to another country I need to get an approved visa.  The fact there is a wall doesn't really change anything other than enforcing boundaries between the two.  Does the USA enforcing their border with Mexico make Mexico a giant open-air prison?

Is it because they lack resources?  If so, I can understand that it might ""feel"" like a prison, but at the same time their government has received billions in aid over the last 18 years and apparently has made no progress except to build rockets and tunnels to launch attacks on Israel.  I think it is crazy generous that Israel has continue to supply utilities for Gaza as long as they have considering it is basically an enemy nation at this point.

Is it because Hamas won't let them leave to other countries?  If so, then that is an internal issue and not Israel's fault.

If Hamas had actually built up Gaza with the money they have received into a respectable territory they would probably have most of the worlds support at pushing diplomatically on Israel to give them more land that they feel entitled to.

""Gazans do not have free access to trade ports or control over their own ability to enter or leave, and live dependant on Israel for basic needs which can be shut off at any time"" is, I guess, too many words to say, which, fair. 

But ""prison"" conjures certain set of images that people love to share - you know those specific grey-scale dominated bombed buildings (which are real places and real damage done to real places real people live!) and that seems more appealing to both sides than the reality that Gaza managed the standard of living but had the wealth inequality it actually had under the conditions.

The term is open for interpretation intentionally to let people conjure their own image. But the existence of luxury resorts and travel visas for tourists and vetted workers doesn't negate the suffering and that people are losing lives and homes. I'm actually surprised people aren't using it more as a sign of how the people clearly just want a normal life like everyone else -- they want over priced restaurants on the beach and tasty street food, and art, and outlet malls.

Let's have a thought experiment for a second:  
It's the last day of Ramadan. Saturday morning. good weather outside, the summer is gone, the fall about to arrive..

Then, out of nowhere (and with no trigger on the days before), 3,000 IDF soldjiers spread all over Gaza, burn houses alive on their families, decapitate babies in their cribs, rape muslim womens and then murder them, kidnap 200 civiliand and taking their into Israel (and god knows what they doing to them there).  
How would the world recat? What would Hizballah in Lebanon do? Iran? Egypt?

Would they attack Israel? will fire rockets? would those rockets hit civilians?  
Or would they do nothing because they don't want to hit civilians and only talk about peace?

**Part I: The King David Hotel Bombing**

In 1946, the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was bombed by the Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary organization led by Menachem Begin. The hotel was being used as the British administrative and military command center. The bombing resulted in 91 deaths and significantly changed British public opinion about their mandate in Palestine. This event was crucial not just in affecting immediate British policy, but also in shaping international perspectives about the Zionist movement, setting the stage for the escalation of tensions in subsequent years.

**Part II: The Sergeant’s Affair** 

In 1947, two British sergeants, Clifford Martin and Mervyn Paice, were abducted by the Irgun as a reprisal for the British execution of three Irgun members. They were subsequently hanged. Known as the “Sergeant’s Affair,” this incident caused public outrage in Britain and accelerated its decision to end its mandate in Palestine. The event also exacerbated tensions between Zionist groups and the British authorities, laying the groundwork for further conflicts in the region.

**Part III: Deir Yassin** 

The 1948 attack on Deir Yassin remains one of the most controversial events in Israeli history. Carried out by Irgun and Lehi, two Jewish paramilitary groups, the attack led to the deaths of a significant number of Palestinian civilians. The event has been widely criticized and remains a focal point in discussions about Israeli-Palestinian relations. Deir Yassin has often been cited by various parties as an example of a massacre, complicating peace efforts and dialogues between Israelis and Palestinians for decades to come.

**Part IV: Count Bernadotte** 

Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden was an appointed UN mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict. In 1948, he was assassinated by members of the extremist Zionist group Lehi. His death exposed the deep divisions within the Zionist movement and put a spotlight on the extreme measures some factions were willing to take. Bernadotte’s assassination severely damaged Israel’s international standing at a critical time and raised questions about the viability of peace mediation efforts in the region.

**Part V: The Lavon Affair**

Intro: Occurring in 1954, the Lavon Affair was a failed covert operation in Egypt. Known as “Operation Susannah,” it was designed to undermine Western confidence in the Egyptian government. Orchestrated under Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon, the operation backfired, leading to his resignation. The scandal had a long-lasting impact, causing internal rifts within Israel’s political landscape and affecting its foreign relations, particularly with the United States and the United Kingdom.

**Part VI: Dimona and the Nuclear Program** 

Israel’s secretive nuclear program was initiated in the late 1950s with the construction of the Dimona Nuclear Research Center in the Negev desert. Spearheaded by key figures like Shimon Peres and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, the program was developed with assistance from France. Although Israel has never confirmed its nuclear capabilities, the program is understood to be a cornerstone of Israel’s security policy. Its undisclosed nature has sparked international controversy and has been a significant point of tension in the Middle East.

**Part VII: The USS Liberty** 

In 1967, during the Six-Day War, the USS Liberty, a United States Navy technical research ship, was attacked by Israeli Air Force jet fighters and Israeli Navy torpedo boats. The attack resulted in 34 crew members being killed and 171 wounded. The incident has been the subject of numerous investigations and theories. It strained U.S.-Israeli relations and led to widespread speculation about the motivations behind the attack, with some believing it was a case of mistaken identity, while others suggest more nefarious intentions.

**Part VIII: Sabra and Shatila** 

During the Lebanese Civil War in 1982, the Sabra and Shatila massacre took place in two Palestinian refugee camps. The massacre was carried out by Lebanese Christian Phalangist militias, but Israeli forces, led by then Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, allowed them entry into the camps. Estimates of the dead vary but include a substantial number of civilians. The event led to international condemnation, and Sharon was found to bear “indirect responsibility,” resulting in his resignation as Defense Minister.

**Part IX: The Cave of the Patriarchs Massacre** 

In 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli settler with far-right political beliefs, opened fire on Palestinian worshippers in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, killing 29 and wounding more than 100. The attack was universally condemned and led to a series of events, including riots and new Israeli security measures, that further complicated relations between Israelis and Palestinians. The massacre also prompted a reevaluation of the security protocols in place in sensitive religious sites.

**Part X: The Killing of Yitzhak Rabin** 

In 1995, Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister and a key figure in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a far-right Israeli law student. The assassination sent shockwaves through Israel and the world, severely hampering the peace process and shifting the trajectory of Israeli politics. The killing polarized Israeli society and revealed the depth of internal divisions about the peace process with the Palestinians.

**Part XI: The Dancing Israelis** 

On September 11, 2001, five Israeli citizens were arrested in New Jersey after being seen filming and celebrating the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. They were later deported without charges but the incident, often referred to as the “Dancing Israelis,” has become the subject of various conspiracy theories and debates about Israel’s foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks. The event has been cited in discussions questioning U.S.-Israeli relations and the extent of intelligence sharing between the two nations.

**Part XII: Ali Jarrah** 

Ali Jarrah was a Lebanese man who spied for Israeli intelligence for more than two decades. He came into the spotlight when it was discovered that his cousin, Ziad Jarrah, was one of the alleged hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks. The case has often been cited as an example of the complex and murky world of Middle Eastern geopolitics and espionage, raising questions about familial and national loyalties and the lengths to which intelligence agencies will go to gather information.",2023-10-23 14:04:33

What of the testimony videos of some of the survivors and released hostages who pointed out that IDF also blocked the festival goers and trapped them in crossfire leading to many deaths or that they they were not harmed in captivity and their injuries treated?

No, none of that will be in the document because it is not a ""complete"" analysis. 

Seriously, people need to post this shit in an objective manner rather than coloring their own pictures to promote a fucking narrative. 

Everyone knows there were atrocities. We want the whole damn picture from the stokholm syndrome people, to the Gazans, to the soldiers' footages, to corroborate every claim that has been made.

The more people do this the more it just discredits and sows more division. Maybe that's the goal. Who knows?",2023-11-04 03:12:22

6560,"I want to put my stance plain and simple right here before I reply to anyone else.

Death begets death begets death!

Do not blame the other side for you attacking them! Blame your own side for continuing the attack!

None of you deserve to be held unaccountable while you continue to ATTACK!

DEFENSIVE ATTACK IS AN OXYMORON AND BOTH SIDES ARE GUILTY OF IT!

last of all in my quiet voice, governments are meant to protect their people rather than attack the enemy. Hamas could do more to build up Gaza, and the Israelis government could do more to get their hostages back.

From a numbers game, Israel gets more financial support than the Palestinians and Palestinians get more civilians killed than Israel.

I am trying my best to work on facts and no claims of “the other side are terrorists” os going to stop me seeing the objective truth of the forest instead of the trees.

Israel either needs to actually allow Palestinian lands to become a countries with self determination asap to avoid looking like a colonial power, or create one state with equal rights for everyone.

Fascism in the world is rising in the world and creating radicals, don’t create more radicals by being more fascist.

Edit: sorry for the facts(provide me proof if you disagree) but as I said “death begets death begets death”.  I just want a simple life for me and my children and these governments are actively destroying that dream. I want evidence that either of these governments are trying to create meetings to deescalate rather than another bomb, until I have proof of this both are evil along with all those that support them. For every bomb I see and every person killed I will condemn those who were “just following orders”

6563,"Here is an updated list of terroristic atrocities committed by Israel upon Gaza since Oct 7, 2023-

​

Israel has used the banned White Phosperous upon both Lebanon and Gaza

Israel has dropped well over 6,000+ bombs upon Gaza in probably the most relentless and devastating bombing campaign unleashed by Israel upon Gaza to date & that's saying something considering how many times Gaza has been pummeled by Israel over the years

Israel directed 1.1+ million Gazans to flee Northern Gaza for Southern Gaza in a matter of 24 hours. This is forced displacement and it is quite impossible to achieve in such little time. Furthermore, Gaza is a really densely packed enclave with 2.3 million ppl of which 50% are children packed into just 141 sq m

So far 1+ million Gazans have been displaced in only 10 days of fighting

So far Israeli bombardment has killed 3,000+ Gazans & wounded 12,500+ Gazans

Israel's military, police & settlers have killed 60+ Palestinians in the West Bank & injured a further 300+

After forcing many in Northern Gaza to flee to Southern Gaza, they lit up the fleeing convoys of civilians killing 70+ in just that attack alone

Also, after issuing a directive to clear Northern Gaza of civilians they have increased bombardment of Southern Gaza which was supposed to be a refuge for fleeing civilians

Today, they bombed a hospital in Southern Gaza killing 500+ Palestinians in that attack alone. This is the deadliest airstrike carried out by Israel in all of its wars since 2008

Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed a Reuters journalist and wounded Al Jazeera journalists

Israel also bombed a hospital killing a Doctor's Without Borders (MSF) aid worker

In addition to bombing hospitals and killing journalists, Israel has bombed refugee camps, mosques, apartment buildings, etc

Israel enacted a total siege upon Gaza in which case electricity, internet, fuel, water, medicine, food, etc are not allowed. This is a human rights violation and a violation of international law. It is tantamount to mass starvation by using starvation as a weapon which is exactly what Hitler did. It is also an example of collective punishment

When aid workers were attempting to deliver much needed supplies to Gaza via the Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt, the only crossing that Israel doesn't control in Southern Gaza, they bombed that area on multiple occasions in order to prevent supplies from coming in

Israel, on more than one occasion, has bombed both Aleppo & Damascus International Airports in Syria. Bombing airports is what terrorists do

A UN-operated school housing thousands of war displaced was also hit with at least 6+ people killed in Gaza",2023-10-17 19:00:36

If the real violence is bad enough, why would you make up more? It just undermines the real horror if 75% of the accusations turn out to be lies. 

Most of this “evidence” is either hearsay or inconclusive, there are videos of violent murder and some photos of dead bodies but I still haven’t seen anything to prove torture or rape or the “beheading of 40 babies” that was claimed. The majority of these are journalists claiming that soldiers told them… that’s not proof!

However, there are literally thousands of videos proving conclusively that Israel are committing hundreds war crimes, even Israeli spokespeople are proudly announcing that they don’t care about international law and are going to commit more war-crimes.",2023-10-17 08:21:12

They refuse to recognise the impossible situation that Israel and the IDF find themself.

There is rarely any recognition of Israel's many achievements, of being a truly inspirational and great country, albeit one with a complicated difficult history. There is never any recognition of how utterly obscene the anti-Israeli insults are, the outright and closet anti-semitism (against Israelis and Jews around the world). There's essentially no recognition of the complexity and humanity of Israel and Israelis. How can you move from there?

Israel are always framed as in the wrong when it's Hamas who have instigated this war, it's Hamas who deliberately target civilians as their policy, it's Hamas who call for genocide, it's Hamas who have used Gazans as human shields, it's Hamas who glorify the Gazan dead as martyrs, it's Hamas who are fighting to install a hateful caliphate in place of a liberal(ish) democracy.

6670,"I definitely think Israel has the right to exist and should exist for the sake of the world. Israel has been a hub of innovation, everyone ive met from Israel is unbelievably smart. Their zeal for development is huge. But i think it may be better for Israel to exist not in the Middle East. Zionists complain about Israel being in a sea of institutionally Islamic nations that are institutionally antisemitic in addition to saying that they are one of the only real democracies in the Middle East, and you look at even the secular republics and they have a lot of problems with checks and balances and being de facto dictatorships in addition to having lots of problems governing over militant sectarian groups that essentially set up their own regimes within sovereign territory. This makes it necessary for Israel to always fight, always have massively equipped military. There is also rationale for Israel to have some amount of control over its direct neighbors - the West Bank and Gaza. First of all, the resources and money needed to maintain such defense systems seems vast. And that seems like such a waste. Imagine what Israel could accomplish if they didn’t have to take all those steps to secure such intense systems of defense. Costa Rica doesn’t have a military at all. Wouldn’t that be a better situation? In addition, the steps that Israel has to take to secure such defense, to much of the world, *look like* systems of oppression of their neighbors. If Israel’s necessary defense systems (and it’s questionable how necessary something like controlling all the entry points of Gaza or having military checkpoints throughout the West Bank are necessary) didn’t look oppressive to much of the world, these are conversations we wouldn’t be having. So as crazy as it might seem, Israel could thrive much more if they were to purchase new territory and transplant the country there. Seems crazy but I seriously think it’s worth considering. And considering the ongoing absurdity of Israel/Palestine relations and the reactions of the rest of the world, it doesn’t even seem that crazy to me. 

But in any case, if that’s completely out of the question, I think that the amount of dispossession that Palestinians have had to endure over the years beginning with the creation of the state of Israel has been extreme and should give you pause. Palestinians were forced to abandon their farmland and businesses, their homes, their communities, because Israel beat them in a military conflict. The initial proposed two-state solution would have had much of the same impact,albeit to a lesser extent, and it makes sense why Palestinians would reject the initial partition. They would have to move and Israelis would get to move in no matter what. What should have happened was a two state partition in which no one felt forced to move from where they were already living. 

At this point, there’s not really any turning back to that point and neither side will agree to a two state solution of any sort, which brings me back to the first point. Or Israel could keep doing what they’re doing which scholars have written about negatively.",2023-11-12 16:18:15

1. The suffering that they had to go through because of Israel.
2. The genocides committee by Israel for decades.

Lol what?? This is extremely questionable if not just outright false. Netanyahu and Putin have gotten along pretty well for years, and Israel has in many ways sided with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 (continuing diplomatic relations with Russia when many countries broke off with them, not sanctioning Russia, not sending weapons to Ukraine, etc).

Russia is somewhat more aggressively supportive of a two-state solution and concessions to the Palestinians than Ukraine, but Ukraine has formally condemned the settlements too, garnering significant Israeli resentment.

I think Ukraine and Russia are about equally aligned with Israel. No strong contrasts can be made here.

Israel and Zionism on the one hand, and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians... will always remain two sides of the same coin... 

The reason why Israelis and Zionists in general... reject any reasonable solution to the Palestinian issue... is that any just solution definitively means the end of Israel as a Jewish state forever ... Without even talking about any displacement of Jews or committing crimes against them...

If it’s osama bin laden and you kill people knowingly staying in his house that’s one thing. If you bomb people who left their homes, have no food or water and no place to go to hopefully kill one guy, it’s a human rights violation and a pretty serious war crime.

Obviously we have to support Israel but we can't afford to give in to Russian intimidation, we must continue to increase the supply of weapons to Ukraine. 

Remember: Putin doesn't allow protests unless they're conveying a message he wants to get out. Protesters in Russia typically are beaten, arrested, or even disappeared.

I think it’s wrong in both sides - and it’s not the fault of the mission but people are unable to distinguish the difference between the person and the government. Also, violence from opinion disagreement. 

Truth is media narrative drives hate - and it seems to be more widespread depending which country, depending what media you consume. Covid, and vilifying China, there was Asian hate and murders; western media in general tends to lean toward white or white appearing people, but I think social media, depending on which platform or who you follow, has more diversity.

Anti-Islam, not so much except perhaps in the countries that have taken Muslim refugees and then had problems with the meshing of the two nationalities.  But no one hates Jews like Muslims do.  This is what the columnist Richard Cohen, from the Washington Post, had to say on October 30, 2001.  **“The Arab world is the last bastion of  unbridled, unashamed, unhidden and unbelievable antisemitism. Hitlerian  myths get published in the popular press as incontrovertible truths.  The Holocaust either gets minimized or denied....How the Arab world will  ever come to terms with Israel when Israelis are portrayed as the devil  incarnate is hard to figure out.”**  

Let me ask you something.  Why do you think that no country, out of the entire Arab League of nations, has offered to help the Palestinians?  Give them shelter?  Set up temporary camps?  Because the one time an Arab country did provide them shelter - Jordan - the Palestinians, infiltrated by PLO fedayeen guerrillas left over from the 1967 Six Day War with Israel, tried to kill King Hussein and take over the government of Jordan.  Whereupon Jordan fought them, pushed them out and allowed them to evacuate to Lebanon.   Four years later, the fedayeen became involved in the Lebanese Civil War.  The truth is that the people living in Gaza and the West Bank are too easily infiltrated by radical extremists.  Their populations are young, 50% under the age of 18 and they are marks for any terrorist group that wants to radicalize them to political extremism.  And they are angry.  Acts of retaliation like the ones we are seeing now in Gaza fuel immense hate.  Yes, there are innocent people living among the terrorists.  And some of them have young men involved with Hamas.

I truly think you are mistaken if you think that antisemitism is the only thing that drives people to speak out against the assault on Gaza. I don’t doubt for a second that there are bigoted people who use the conflict as an excuse to target Jews. What happened in Dagestan is a prime example of that.

Hitlerian  myths get published in the popular press as incontrovertible truths.  The Holocaust either gets minimized or denied....How the Arab world will  ever come to terms with Israel when Israelis are portrayed as the devil  incarnate is hard to figure out.”**  

Let me ask you something.  Why do you think that no country, out of the entire Arab League of nations, has offered to help the Palestinians?  Give them shelter?  Set up temporary camps?  Because the one time an Arab country did provide them shelter - Jordan - the Palestinians, infiltrated by PLO fedayeen guerrillas left over from the 1967 Six Day War with Israel, tried to kill King Hussein and take over the government of Jordan.  Whereupon Jordan fought them, pushed them out and allowed them to evacuate to Lebanon.   Four years later, the fedayeen became involved in the Lebanese Civil War.  The truth is that the people living in Gaza and the West Bank are too easily infiltrated by radical extremists.  Their populations are young, 50% under the age of 18 and they are marks for any terrorist group that wants to radicalize them to political extremism.  And they are angry.  Acts of retaliation like the ones we are seeing now in Gaza fuel immense hate.  Yes, there are innocent people living among the terrorists.  And some of them have young men involved with Hamas.  How to separate them?  Remember Vladimir Lenin said, ""Show me who your friends are and I will tell you what you are.""",2023-10-31 11:44:32

And there are Palestinians who believe Israel should not exist and jews should not have a nation in the area, or even not exist at all.

Of course the Palestinian people had been there much longer and are the original owners of the land, but the Jews who settled in the region didn’t have a place to go due to the rampant anti semitism in Europe at the time. Yes the solution that was agreed upon was not a good idea and obviously would lead to conflict but the situation was not ideal and options were limited. Fast forward and the entire region was untied against Israel since almost its inception as a state. The lack of anyone actually trying to look at the situation from the Israelis perspective is baffling, obviously the only way to preserve the citizens of the nation of Israel and prevent genocide would be to militarily dominate the region. Any instance of military defeat/collapse would have been catastrophic to the people who live there and they hadn’t chose where they were going in the first place. As horrible as putting Palestinians in cages and kicking them out of their rightful land is, the other side of that coin is a genocide so horrific it would rival the holocaust in death toll.

However, how someone is killed is very important for forming opinions of observers.

But when u see someone is being dragged from their car, raped, or beheaded. With their visceral face expressions, fear in their eyes, etc. Everyone can connect better with them. It creates bigger emotion in you as a viewer.

This effect known by advertisers and movie creators. In every movie after explosion you show people and their faces in close up. Without that, a viewer won’t be able to connect.

And western media is really good at playing this information game. Way better than any muslim nation. 

I saw hamas representative speaking and UK Palestinian ambassador speaking on TV and although they were very passionate but the only thing they sad was 1000s of Palestinians were killed during 70 years, we don’t have food, we live in occupation blab blah blah.

Hamas aren’t freedom fighters, but nor are the IDF fighting some powerful nation unable to protect itself from it…
The reality is that Israeli government knows that radicalising the population by plunging them into poverty with no recourse will give them the justification they need to gain popular support.

And the reality is that even if you replace Palestinian with any other group of people if they are treated the same, the same thing would happen to them.

Hamas has legitimacy because it fights Isreal but also the Isreali government has legitimacy because as long as they have someone to fight they will continue to gain popular support.

7179,"Firstly that is not the way of it at all. Just listen to how the US is talking about the situation, focussing entirely on Hamas’s evil attack while ignoring the context in which it arises, both historical and recent eg with Bibi and his settlements and so forth. The fact that they are Israel’s lawyer rather than an honest broker is part of the reason that this cannot be resolved in the first place.

Second even if that were the situation it’s very obvious why that would be. Israel is the oppressor in the broader context; they rocked up and took over occupied land after 1000 years of absence with the cooperation of Britain (largely for reasons of expediency and collective European guilt about atrocities committed against the Jews … by people other than those whose land was to be taken), made the Palestinians (or Arabs if you prefer) a minority in their own country with all the discrimination that entails, continue to settle even more land so that even a two state solution becomes increasingly hopeless, respond to armed struggle with occupation, apartheid, and endless ‘collateral damage’, etc etc. It is the same reason that white-on-black racism is not seen as morally equivalent to the converse. One side is in the wrong in macro/historical terms. 

And tbh the Israelis were willing to live with it, with their mowing the grass analogies and the like; quite happy to wear the occasional rocket and some lecturing in the press as long as they can have their nice big state and their Jerusalem etc. No doubt they figure that if they can hold it for 1000 years the right and wrong of the situation will necessarily give way to the facts on the ground and the rights that this of itself creates (which is true, though I think history will judge Israel more harshly than Saladin and the like, given modern sensibilities). Regardless, it may be that they will need to pay a bigger price than they reckoned on. It’s a very dangerous game imo to oppress that many people to that extent, particularly in a context of religious antipathy as well. It’s not like the old days where you could just slaughter them, and you can foil a thousand attacks but only one needs to get through to cause catastrophic damage.

I feel very sorry for these young Israelis that lost their lives but for myself if I was Jewish I would not migrate there and if I was born there I would immigrate. It is far from the only state founded on force of arms but imo the crime (in moral terms) is too recent, the oppression too great, and there is too much hatred.

7193,"Was going to make my own post till I saw this. Here’s what I’ll add, was just going to be my post

Genocide

I thought I’d weigh in on this topic as I’ve seen this word thrown around a lot over the past month. Ill start by make my stance clear, so that if you oppose my viewpoint & have no interest in changing your mind you can skip straight to commenting, Israel is not committing a genocide, an ethnic cleansing could be argued. 

Genocide - let’s begin by establishing a definition. Many people, different bodies, hell even the UN will have their own definitions for what constitutes a genocide. The UN defines genocide as “a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part” I believe it later adds different caveats/addendums but my issue is the statement “in part” this is super ambiguous. Because of this I prefer the Oxford dictionary definition “the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group” large may still be somewhat ambiguous but it conveys at least the severity of killing required to rise to the level of genocide. What both, and really all, definitions share in common though is that the intent must be to destroy a nation or group. 

With that in mind let’s refocus on Israel v. Gaza. When determining what constitutes “intent to destroy a nation or group”, and what qualifies as “a large number of people” it’s important to look at the number of people killed, vs’s the population, over a given period of time; however, what I believe is equally important is to weigh this against the capabilities the given entity has for destruction. 

So when we look at the situation in Gaza we have a population of 2 million people under siege. Over the past month we have seen roughly 12,000 casualties, with no real way to verify combatant vs’s civilian. To put this number into perspective we have to look at Israel’s capabilities. In ww2 the US killed 80-100,000 Japanese in a bombing campaign of Tokyo, not the atomic bomb for those who don’t know. Tokyo today has a population density of around 16,000 per square mile, 6.1k/km, and Gaza city has around 21,000 per square mile, 8.1k/km. So does Israel have the destructive capabilities of a ww2 US, I would have to say yes, they could certainly inflict damage of that scale. 

So why have we only seen around 10k deaths in a month? Israel has not carpet bombed, indiscriminately bombed, or intentionally targeted civilians. They have given multiple opportunities for civilians to leave, and have even provided protection to them as they evacuated. Israel is very clearly targeting Hamas & not attempting to commit a genocide, if they wanted to they could. As I said an ethnic cleansing could be argued based on what follows this campaign but a genocide is ludicrous to argue. 

On the other hand Hamas…do they rise to the level of a ww2 US? Absolutely not, they look like a Stone Age power in comparison. So when we look at October 7th, while keeping in mind what they are capable of, does that rise to the level of a genocide? I would actually argue Yes. They came in intentionally targeting civilians, they killed 1200 people which is likely the upper limit of what their military is capable of, and their stated goal is to eradicate Israel.",2023-11-25 19:19:18

7216,"I don’t like the word “genocide” in any context, and avoid using it in any context to describe any event, because it’s a dangerous combination of imprecise and provocative. The charge of genocide hinges on *intent*. Intent has a mental and subjective component, and as such is notoriously difficult to prove in a court of law for an individual defendant, let alone an accused group of people whose intents vary, are subject to change, and are often not explicitly stated.

Where is the line between genocide and casualties of war?
Where is the line between genocide and extreme racism, that takes wantonly violent forms?
Where is the line between genocide and large scale forced displacement?
Where is the line between genocide and strong social pressure and/or policy incentives to culturally assimilate?

I believe in supporting nonviolent conflict resolution whenever possible. I am against anyone deliberately harming anyone for no other reason than who they are and who their people are. And I support freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, that don’t deny these freedoms for anyone else. (Y’know… liberal Enlightenment values.) Violations of these principles are best discussed and resolved by sticking to the facts of what happened, with everyone involved checking their feelings and rhetoric at the door..

7222,"I’m going to be as civil as possible. What Israel is doing is literally a textbook case of genocide and ethnic cleansing. I’ll explain by arguing your claims. 

1. Israel has indeed made their intentions clear that they want to uproot the Palestinian population completely. And I’m not going by statements of some fringe elements in their government, but the prime minister himself. Earlier this year, at the UN general assembly, he displayed a map that showed Palestine completely wiped off. He calls them “human animals”, “children of darkness” and many Israeli govt officials have stated that they want to turn Gaza into a “parking lot”, a “soccer field”, etc. This is clear genocidal intent. 

2. Genocide and ethnic cleansing is less about the death toll than about the actions and intentions. They have deprived the Palestinians of water, food, resources time and time again. They do not allow any significant development to take place in Gaza. They allow very little cement or steel to enter into Gaza. Their most common bombing targets are hospitals, schools, universities, doctors, lawyers, engineers. They are destroying all potential for Gaza to develop and want to make it unliveable. 

3. Israel may have been forced out of Gaza in 2005 due to resistance forces and international pressure, but they still had control over their water and airspace. It was still occupied and Israel controlled many regulations there. Moreover, they came back with 12,000 new settlers later. 

4. That’s absolutely incorrect. Israel doesn’t “supply” “free” water and electricity. Israel’s only role is allowing water to be transported inside Gaza Strip, which they sometimes restrict, like now. And as for electricity, it’s obviously not free, plus Gazans can’t build an electricity plant in Gaza themselves since they need a permit for that from Israel, which of course, they never got. This is another brutal way of controlling and depriving Palestinians of resources. Since they don’t let Palestinians have an independent supply of resources, they can stop the supply anytime to starve the Palestinians. 

5. Palestinians in Israel work as labourers, construction workers, etc and not in secure jobs. And that’s because Israel can’t have its own citizens work menial jobs like that. Notice how when they cancelled Palestinian labourers’ work permits, they ask for manual labourers from India and didn’t want to put their own citizens in hazardous jobs. Palestinians have always been subhumans for Israel. 

6. Oslo accords wasn’t Israel’s initiative, it was brought about by international pressure and Norway and US’s mediation. Moreover, when Oslo accords were signed and agreement was made for a Palestinian state, right wing Israelis did not tolerate it and Israel’s then PM Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated, which caused the agreement to fall apart. It’s only Ben Shapiro who lies to you that the Arabs rejected it. Furthermore, even at the time of the Balfour Declaration, Zionists wanted the entire land rather than it being divided. Israel has never wanted a 2-state solution. Some do, actually and it’s a shame that such a “democratic” country isn’t hearing its people. 

7. No, that’s also incorrect, Israel barely ever gives building permits, let alone funding infrastructure. Also, again, their only role is to allow transport of humanitarian aid from other countries. And it’s quite illogical to keep bombing them and then send as consolation humanitarian aid lol. The best aid Israel can give Palestinians is human treatment and ending the illegal occupation. 

8. Yes, death toll ≠ genocide, but like I stated in my first point, it’s the actions and intent. And Israel has made its genocidal intentions very clear. They come up with new excuses everyday to try to prove that Palestinian innocent civilians are legitimate military targets by accusing them of being “human shields”, “terrorists”, “terrorist supporters”, “indoctrinated since birth to hate Jews”, etc. and targeting schools, hospitals and universities by claiming they are military bases of Hamas.

7230,"I like to answer this way.

What I’ve come to learn a lot about since living through 4 wars and an attack on America I watched from below and had to smell everyday for months  to follow was about the Genocide in Rwanda in 1997 and the failure of Bill Clinton and his admin to pay attention. No, of course we aren’t the world police, but we also are, right.

In Rwanda the Hutu’s couped the Tutsi’s and seized government. The when the Tutsi faction began to amass at the borders, the Hutu military through government records compiled lists of all Tutsi’s and set up traffic stops. Once they vegan the slaughter, they went door to door. Groups of people gathered in the Canadian and Americans embassies. This kept about 5000 people safe, our countries recalled the embassy staff. They workers described as the drove away watching as the Hutus militia enter and slaughter everyone in the compounds.

To be fair, we weren’t aware this was an actual genocide until it was over. In 100 days they violently and officially  slaughtered 1million Tutsis. Without guns using garden tools and machetes only. It was a very dark moment in history.

Hotel Rwanda is a true movie based upon a Tutsi hotel that was able to save 25,000 lives. If you haven’t seen it. It’s hard to watch, very, but I also think it is very important to.

It’s relevant here to note that Clinton was given intel that civil war had broken out and their was concern that the death toll was extraordinarily high. Think - hundreds of thousands (not thousands).

Afterwards when the agencies came in, it was clear, the lists, the stops, the dead people in there homes. That’s what citizens of the world (over the age of 35 anyway) would call “evidence of intent”.

The U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” The acts include “killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group, and/or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”

Moronic maths of an average of 800 a year for the last 75 years is quite frankly idiotic.

3) Just because the population has gone UP in the last 20 years doesn't mean Israel hasn't been killing Palestinians indiscriminately. Furthermore, the genocide has only started to ramp up. 17,000 lives 50 days and millions displaced.

4) Just because Israel ""gave Gaza back"" in 2005 gives no credence to the non-genocide cause. If you were planning to bomb a country to bits, wouldn't you leave and block supplies from entering?

Cries of Israel committing genocide are about as genuine as claims “from the river to the sea…” is simply a desire for “occupation” to end, it is not, it’s a call for the genocide of Jews.  The explanation that this is no longer the intended meaning of the phrase is ridiculous…on that logic Nazis can change the “intended meaning” of the Nazi salute to be a simple polite greeting, and the laws forbidding its use would no longer apply.  

Any while we’re talking about pro-Palestinians re-writing the dictionary, Israel no longer occupies Gaza…Israel does not prevent Palestinians from using its border with Egypt to move in and out of, Egypt does.  So unless Israel and Egypt are in kahoots to occupy Gaza, and surely everyone agrees the only common ideology between Egypt and Israel is their intention of not allowing any risk of any militant Palestinians cross their own borders into their country, then how does Israel occupy Gaza?  In fact, Israel does allow thousands of Palestinians to enter Israel daily, and yes it is very strict on who may enter and for what purpose, its survival relies on it.

7260,"The misuse and misappropriation of language is part of the bogus outrage machine ginned up by Arabs and Muslims whenever Jews defend themselves. The outrage machine only pretends to be in sympathy with Palestinians.

We know this bc there is never any equivalent outrage about the cruel treatment of Palestinians in Muslim-majority countries. Why not? Why is the machine always and only brought out when the State of Israel is involved?

Where’s the outrage about the apartheid policy of Lebanon toward Palestinians? After 75 years Palestinians in Lebanon remain stateless refugees, denied economic self-sufficiency. Where’s the love and solidarity for them?

Where were the screaming mobs on campus and in European capitals during the murder of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians by starvation and bombings in the Syrian civil war? Which, by the way, Iran abetted bc Assad is a member of a small Shia sect. So it was okay for him to slaughter Sunni Palestinians by the thousands. Where was the outrage? 

Palestinians have no friends in Arab- and Muslim-majority states. The Egyptians loathe them, had to be forced to open their barrier to refugees from Gaza. Lebanon’s and Syria’s actions speak for themselves. The Gulf states pay lip service to Palestinian rights, but refuse citizenship to skilled Palestinians who work there. Every single Muslim-majority country refuses full rights to the Palestinians—if they are not actively killing them!

Ironically, nowhere do Palestinians get the rights extended by the State of Israel to its Palestinian Arab citizens. They vote, go to school, enter professions, run businesses, have families, prosper. Is everything perfect? No of course not, what state is? But it’s far better for Palestinians there than in Arab-and Muslim-majority autocracies—otherwise they’d leave. But they choose to stay. Why? Because where in the Middle East would Palestinians want to go? Arabs and Muslims don’t do democracy, don’t forget. 

So it’s clearly not love and solidarity with Palestinians that motivates the furious and violent mobs in all the Arab- and Muslim-majority states, on campuses, and in Europe. It’s hatred of the Jews. 

That’s how we get the “g” word. The so-called lovers of Palestine have to invent their facts, because they literally hate the reality. They can’t let historic evidence enter the discussion, so they have to invent history. With invention of history comes the false and misleading use of language.

Examples of history the Arabs and Muslims can’t acknowledge:

—They can’t acknowledge the archaeological and extra-Biblical texts that confirm the evolution of Judaism in the ancient kingdoms of Judah and Israel from 1300 BCE.

—They can’t admit that Jews ever built a Temple in Jerusalem. In fact, the Waqf will not allow any archaeological examination of the Temple Mount. They’re afraid of what might be found. 

—They can’t accept clear evidence of the ethnic cleansing of Jews by the Romans from the kingdom of Judea.

—They can’t even tolerate their students being taught about the Nazi death camps. A Palestinian professor in Israel was terminated by his university and forced to flee the country after bringing his Arab students to Auschwitz to teach them something about the mindset of Jews in Israel. 

Arabs have to deny the truth to their students of what happened to the Jews in WWII. Otherwise their whole narrative of rage falls apart.

Show me any Arab- or Muslim-majority country in which Arab students are exposed to the history of the Holocaust. The Arab and Muslim supporters of Palestinians operate in vehement, vicious, intentional ignorance, and pass that ignorance and hate along to their children.

Where facts and history are denied, false constructs, inapt parallels, and misused and inflammatory language are substituted:

—“Genocide.” 
—“Colonization.” 
—“Apartheid.” 

Hideous distortions, in service of denial. Intended to deceive and entrap.

The truth is, it’s all about Jew hatred. The outrage of Arabs and Muslims only explodes into violence when Jews defend themselves. 

But they know they cannot express that to Westerners who know something of the real history, it’s unacceptable. So they dissemble. They just “want to kill every motherf—-g Zionist.”  

https://lamag.com/news/usc-in-free-speech-furor-over-student-who-tweeted-i-want-to-kill-every-motherf-cking-zionist

They dare not say “Jew.” It’s unacceptable in polite society. But that’s what they mean. They want to divide Jews from their history, and erase the return of Jews to what is factually and demonstrably their historic ancestral homeland. Just take Jews out of their homeland, and everything will be fine, right? (Put Hamas in charge there, instead! Wouldn’t the world be a better place?)

BTW notice how all the pro-Palestinian demonstrators hide their faces. The law in most Western countries lets them tell their story, however they want. But the law does not protect them from the consequences of public disapproval of what they say. Their employer may not want to be represented in public by Palestinian haters of Jews. Their schools may also take action: expel them, fire them, defund their projects, etc. They may have difficulty explaining their Jew hatred to future employers. When you espouse Jew hatred every time Jews defend themselves, you might pay a price. 

That is why they cover their faces. They don’t want to be held accountable.",2023-11-26 14:42:02

7291,"your whole reasoning is flawed:

1-> there have been many israeli rallies calling for the death of all arabs even before this war. the politicians have called the palestinian human animals, NOT hamas but palestinians. The israeli president saying there are no innocent civilians in gaza. The israeli ambassador to UN calling the palestinian people as ""horrible inhuman animals"".  and the worst :general giora eiland publicaly stated : ""Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist"". These quotations are from high ranking officials not some random civilans. Its important that they explicitly said ""palestinian"" not HAMAS. so yes even if some claim that it has no intention of genocide its important to realise that they want the palestinian gone from the area.

2->its crazy to me how the death of 800 people every year sounds like mercy to you. The palestinians people die everyday and that doesnt even take into account on how the palesitnians that are alive have there basic rights violated. with UN calling northern  gaza a hell on earth. Their infrastructure is demolished with often false claims of hamas bases.just because the nazi's had a higher body count doesnt diminsh the efforts israel has made in making palestinian lives torturous to say the least.

&#x200B;

3-> Again the population has gone up cause, Musllims have a trend of procreating multiple times and the fact that their religion allows for multiple marriages explains why the populations increased. Just because some people are harder kill doesnt mean the others dont wanna kill them. hypothetically : I fumigate my house every few years to kill insects inside my house and around it, doesnt mean that i have not tried exterminated them even if theyre net population has increased.

4-> well, its a good thing that israel returned gaza after much international pressure, but that didnt stop them from bombing the gazan's and even after it was returned many restrictions were put on them like restricting building materials.  The city wasnt exactly free just not under israel.  Besides israel returning gaza is no mercy they were returning what they had taken by force.

5->Israel supplies ""free water"" but the price is human lives as they dont even supply 5% of the actual need, keeping 95% for themselves. Im sure we dont have to go over the israeli's pipes that hamas uses for their rockets, pipes that israel used to steal water from palestinians.

6-> this i will have to give to israel, cause its true that israel does do that but this alone doesnt change that every other action israel has done to torture the palestinians.

7-> The land that they have tried to give doesnt include other occupied land such as East jerusalem and  the other cities that israel occupied and settled people over the years. So yes Israel had some fault in the failure of those talks.

8->It is important to note the reason humanitarian aid is needed in the first place is cause the devastation israel cause in its attack and the nakba where 70,000 were forced to flee and take refuge in the area. so the humanitarian crisis is solely israel's fault.  If left  to israel it wouldnt allow the humanitarian aid enter at all as shown by recent actions.

9->this point is perhaps the most evil of all the above mentioned and goes to show how redundant arguments regarding the matter are as it leads to whataboutism and for short YES those were massacres and genocide. The only  reason they are not seen as genocide and massacre is because the US won and the victors are the ones that dictate history. The US is the biggest terrorist state in the world, lets not get started of the iraq war, the ""weapons of mass destructions"", where are they?  Ask anyone in the east and they would agree that the US is the biggest terrorist.  German civilians that were affected and would definetly call it a genocide and these under the geneva conventions would be war crimes.

The whole point of the geneva conventions is to prevent atrocities like these from happening ever again. Almost every point except israel providing jobs is moot.

The situation is a genocide. We have surpassed the Nakba(that was the catastrophe) in 45 days. 

Claim that just because Israeli ministers called for genocide and the army killing 20,000 doesn’t mean it’s a genocide is like a brain dead person making an argument. If a lot of government ministers ask for genocide and the army is doing it then it’s genocide.  

Palestinians population going up by 4x doesn’t mean anything. Just because the birth rate is higher than the death rate doesn’t mean a genocide is not going on

Israel didn’t leave Gaza they turned it into a concentration camp. They control the airspace, supplies, water. That kind of treatment is exactly what caused oct7 to happen. 

Comparing Gaza to nazi style camps is wrong because those camps were secret until the Allie’s liberated them. The German population knew the Jews were taken somewhere but that is all they knew. Israelis cannot do that because in a world where everyone has camera and internet it is hard to hide.

Israel only provides labour jobs to Palestinians. The lowest level bottom of the barrel contracts that they can give. All under the table. Same as concentration camps they used Jews for manual labour for the most part. Those camps also provided food and water and shelter. You see how stupid that sounds trying to make a concentration camp sound nice. That is what Israelis are doing

lol Israel built a lot of infrastructure. Yeah that was at a time they had the illegal settlements in Gaza. Look at the names of the hospitals “Indonesian hospital, Al Shifa” these are all donations from other countries. Israel made really good infrastructure for their settlers

Saying one bad apple is the traditional Israeli playbook answer. Disciplining one person for crimes that 1000s have done is of no use. Most of the their crimes are unpunished but they impact the civilian population. The constant terror they face. This is why is called a genocide.

•12,000 Palestinians in the last 50 days have been murdered. We are ahead of the game in labeling it as genocide which it is. If you do the math that’s almost a million per year at this rate. Plus I’m just going to add this since we are doing comparisons. Indigenous people in Canada experienced genocide. It was genocide. You don’t put a number in how many are killed if they’re being eradicated in any number.  
•Just because the population of Gaza Palestinian people is going up doesn’t cancel out that genocide is taking place. Making more babies doesn’t cancel out murdering them or Palestinians. 
•Nazis gave sequestered parcels of communities to Jews as they also told them to find another place to go. They took Gaza from the Palestinians in the first place. Great they gave it back but they still haven’t given back so many portions of land they occupied since 1948
•Nazis also supplied water and electricity to Jews albeit in controlled quantities (as they do now) They cut off electricity and water supply whenever they want to. All the while they’re committing Genocide 
•Nazis also gave jobs to Jews. The jobs are not well paying jobs. When you have to separate and say Jews give jobs to Palestinians but cannot say Palestinians employ Jewish people too then you’ve got a problem. One is in control the other is not. 
•Skipping to your last point. 12,000 Gazans in 50 days 4,000 of them being children dying because of carpet bombing with nowhere for them to flee is Genocide. You cannot compare the above nations of committing genocide, but there are thoughts on the above conflicts that I would have opinions on.

A lot of the elements of it were deliberately formed by taking  traditional Russian antisemitism and Nazi philosophy and recasting it against ""Zionists"" rather than Jews as a race but meaning the same thing. 

As Jews lost these power struggles to have a smaller (though still large) role many feminist movements became infused with Zionolgy.  Due to the AIDS Crisis the leadership of the gay rights movement went from gay men to lesbians.   A lot of political lesbians came from feminist circles which caused many gay rights groups to pick up Zionolgy.  Though at this point the Soviet Union wasn't cool and radical anymore so Zionolgy was called ""Palestinian Solidarity"". 

It should be noted actual Palestinians played little role in ""Palestinian Solidarity"" though there some like Edward Said. Bring in actual Palestinians to have some meaningful voice  happened with the transition of Palestinian Solidarity to BDS which was a rebranding of Palestinian Solidarity during the 2nd Intifada when ""armed resistance"" became much less fashionable. 

So today Gay Rights groups often have a large BDS contingent even though actual Palestinians in Palestine hate gays. This has a lot to do with the dynamics of American feminism in the 1970s and little else.",2023-10-21 22:47:36

No peace is ever going to be possible. It would mean a complete change of ideology and heart for the entire Palestinian people and all their allies. Even those in the west. That's just not going to happen. The level of insanity and crazed religious fervor is too deep.

Whoever raped should be punished and all victims deserve privacy, respect, and all of our collective support. Nothing ever makes it okay.

(Now a lot of people doubting this should be ashamed of themselves. We should learn to by default trust the victims. The issue is colonialism (something most of the people doubting Hamas rapes have experienced or been adversely effected by) has a history of false rape allegations to make the indigenous men sub human and justify killing or persecuting them.

Do the semen samples say ""hamas""? Lol. It was a fkng party with drinks and drugs and people having sex. Before Hamas barged in. Of course there's gonna be semen all over the place.

7521,"Ok let’s presume that this is true and Hamas raped women. 

I would agree that the people who did that should pay for it and face consequences. Every man who raped should be jailed/killed.

The problem with Israel was not that they are not allowed to seek justice for this, it’s that their response was to collectively punish all 2.2 million Palestinians for the actions of Hamas. Israel finds every man woman and child Gaza responsible for that crime. 

This does not happen anywhere else in the world. It’s only happened a couple times before in history, and Jewish people were the victims. 


Even war has rules, and Israel’s response has not been in the interest of Israeli civilians or Palestinian civilians. It was just pure revenge and suffering that has not achieved much but lose them international support and sympathy. Hamas is still alive. They probably created 10 extremists terrorists for every one they killed.

7526,"Yeah... An op-ed which is authored by someone who clearly believes the rapes happened is not proof that they actually occurred. 

In the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7th, Israel media reported:

\-That 40 babies had been beheaded. That was false; two children/ babies were killed that day (a horrific, evil tragedy) however neither case looks like they were directly targeted. (A war crime, nonetheless.)

\-That pregnant women had their unborn fetuses cut out of their stomachs before being left to die. This report has absolutely no evidence; it's likely completely fabricated.

\-That women were raped. What spurred this accusation was the video of the girl with blood on the back of her pants, who was being forced into a jeep as a captive. 

Of these three claims, we know two of them were false. The third one, being mass rapes, hasn't necessarily been confirmed to be a lie, but whatever evidence Israel supposedly has they've refused to share it with the group responsible for investigating the claims. Supposedly, a woman was found dead and naked, and Israel claims she was gang raped before being shot. Until the evidence of this crime is brought to light, I refuse to say that this claim is true.

Israel does this a lot. They lie or refuse to correct a lie because it serves their interests, and then after some time has passed when asked for confirmation (meaning evidence) they will share a piece of ""evidence"" that proves nothing about their baseless claims, and then they'll say that you're just antisemitic for doubting their accounting of events. This is what they do. 

If Israel cooperates with the investigation, (which they won't, because they're lying) and it proves to be true that Hamas fighters raped women on Oct. 7th, I will fully condemn the acts totally and utterly. Until then, I will continue to assume that Israeli propaganda is pushing a false narrative to justify how many innocent civilians they're killing in Gaza.",2023-12-01 23:37:20

I'm so tired of people on \*both sides\* of this conflict paint it as a simple perpetrator/victim narrative. Israel has committed war crimes and targeted civilians, including women and children. They've cut off water and electricity to innocent Palestinians, some in hospitals. Hamas has kidnapped and brutally murdered civilian men, women, and children, laughing about the savage attacks on them. They've raped Israeli women and used children as shields. Neither one of these sides gets to claim any moral superiority at this point. Both have targeted innocent people in their political goals. Both have engaged in war crimes while fighting for their cause. One does not justify the other. The response to violence against innocents should not be violence against innocents. If you believe Hamas militants' tactics in killing civilians are wrong, then you should not use those tactics in carpet bombing Gaza, bombing hospitals, schools, and media buildings. If you believe Israel's oppression of Palestinian civilians is wrong, then you lose all moral high ground by slaughtering, raping, and kidnapping Israeli civilians.

This is straight from Smotrich. 

Right now, it’s been confirmed that reports of sexual violence and ‘beheading babies’ are unsubstantiated and are not rooted in any evidence. Right now, Israel is committing war crimes against Gazans, a million of them children. They have targeted ambulances, killed medics, UN workers and journalists. There are 1100 dead in Gaza and 5300 injured. There are 100 newborns and 1000 dialysis patients now relying on emergency generators to stay alive, with maximum 2-4 days power.

The terrorism of Hamas should be condemned, but so should the state-sanctioned terrorism of Israel.

Just like you, there is a 14  year old Palestenian kid in Gaza strip feeling the same exact way. Their are many antrocities that both the IDF and Hamas have done to each side for years. Some more barbaric than others. This attack being one of them.

 Also, i know that IDF horrific actions do not represent the Israeli people. Just like Hamas terrorists horrific actions do not represent the whole Palestinians. Their is a reason this attack is so controversial, and many not feeling sorry for Israel. Its not black and white like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The conflict between Israel and Gaza is so much more complicated, with no easy solution. Dont even think their is one, other than ethnic cleansing, which would be worse and more barbaric than this attack. 


Having said that, their is no justification on Hamas attacking Israeli civilians. The kidnappings, torture, rape, murder and parading of dead bodies of elderly, women and kids is horrific and barbaric of things.

It is gross seeing palestian immigrants celebrating in western countries of this attack. I understand that they hate Israel for its own antrocities that have committed against Palestinians. It's all gross, disgusting, and no easy solution since this hatred for each other has passed on for generations and generations keep passing it down.

Hunker down and stay safe. It's going to be hard not to hate after this.

7646,"Hamas just perpetrated one of the largest terrorist attacks in history. It's clear from the massacre at the concert and the videos of combatants going door to door that they were purposely targeting civilians, and the Hamas leadership and participants in the attack certainly deserve what is coming to them. 

That said, I feel it's at least important to understand the Palestinian perspective, and why so many people in the Gaza strip would partly or fully support a terrorist group like Hamas. Since 2008, according to the UN[1], over 5000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the Gaza strip, most by airstrike. It's hard to tell how many of these might be civilians, but even Israeli estimates[2] (at least from the flareup in 2014) put the number at 45%. Of course, the IDF undertakes some measures to lessen civilian causalties, Hamas operates out of civilian areas purposely, and civilian killed by the IDF are ""collateral damage"", where the military is at least trying to kill a legitimate target. Also, if Hamas had the same means as the IDF, they probably would have killed far more Israelis.

However, if you were a family member of one of the civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes, I'm sure you would feel pretty angry at the IDF, and callous towards the Israeli civilians who tacitly or explicitly support them, just as Israelis who have lost family members to the wanton rocket attacks, suicide bombings, or the most recent massacre feel the same about Palestinians. The IDF does not target civilians like Hamas, but it's clear from their tactics and the numbers above that avoiding civilian deaths is not their top priority. 

Again, I'm not equivocating Hamas and Israel, or denying Israel's people's right to defend themselves, or even disagreeing that Hamas should be toppled. I just think that you shouldn't let your justified anger work against attempts at reconciliation in the future, or lead to the unnecessary deaths of even more people.

Hamas is horrible, and should not get support what so ever. It still does not make it ok that innocent people in Gaza doesn't have basic human rights. And Israel is a part of that. The fact that Israel is a part of that, does not mean that the attacks from Hamas is ok. The leadership in both countries are commiting warcrimes and doing horrible things. Even if Hamas is worse, it doesn't make the actions of Israels goverment ok. My problem is the fact that is seems like if Hamas does something awfull, it gives Israel a free pass to do whatever for some people. Like now, Israel is responding with leveling buildings with the ground and killing a bunch of civilians. That's not ok. The attacks needs to be more targeted, they have a choice.

Every bullet that flies through the air, every tank that is on the streets of Gaza, every bomb that falls from the sky, every innocent person who is laying in the city streets, is all because Hamas has its finger on the trigger.

If you go into a bank with a gun to rob it, every person who dies is a murder charge for you, because no matter who dies, even if it is your own getaway driver who is shot by a bank guard, none of it would have happened if you hadn't walked into that bank with a gun.

People say ""but what about civilians"" .. yeah, what about food, water, power, why are you asking Israel these questions when Hamas is responsible for the population of Gaza ?  Hamas knew on October 6th that it was about to turn Gaza into a battlefield and that tens of thousands of civilians were going to die.  The supporters of Hamas knew that Hamas would commit terrorist attacks, so if the supporters of Hamas and Hamas itself don't care that its civilian population dies on the streets of Gaza, how is this Israel's problem ?  Go ask Hamas where the population of Gaza is supposed to go, they set these events into motion.

Israel's only responsibility now is the destruction of Hamas to ensure O7 never happens again, to end the half measures, to stop letting Hamas, the Palestinians, and the leftist world continue to use Israel's humanity against it as a weapon.  Israel's responsibility is to hunt down and end Hamas.  The desire to show humanity and care to others is not a SUICIDE PACT.

Hamas can end the suffering of the people of Gaza right now, all they have to do is put down their weapons, release the hostages, and face justice for October 7th.  Until that happens, blood will be shed, and every drop of that blood will be on the hands of Hamas and everyone who supports Hamas.

But I see now that there are some bad actors in our world who listen only to violence, and have no problem dishing it out. Being peaceful toward such people does not make the world a more peaceful place.

It was a real rude awakening for me sometime last decade to pick up a scholarly book with ""Peace Studies"" in its name by Prof David Barash, and find it wasn't at all lovey-dovey, and certainly not by or for idealistic dreamers. It was in fact a rather sobering, borderline *cynical* look at human nature and human society, and evolutionary reasons why war and violence are the default, and peace is a big accomplishment. And usually a fleeting one. But I think anyone *serious* about promoting peace needs to either face these facts, or admit that peace activism might be a job for somebody else, with a stronger stomach than themselves.

That doesn't mean that Ben Gvir and Smotrich and Gila and her memos and Bibi and his weakness and corruption don't *terrify* us on the other side of the fence...and I'm speaking as a friend.

They are calling it the second Yom Kippur War, right? The first one involved my country and Israel. What did we get out of it? The most durable and unexpected peace, which led to the most genuine and deep friendship and partnership that has lasted through all the ups and downs of the last 40 years. Making peace between us in 1973 was hard, but I'm so glad we tried and pushed and made it happen, despite peace costing me a President and you a Prime Minister.

The forces of light and darkness are those that seek peace and equality versus those that don't. It's Ben Gvir and his settler terrorists and Hamas and their terrorists, neither of whom believe in equality or two states, and are genocidal messianic maniacs seeking total control. That's not acceptable. I choose light. Light is peace, equality, justice. I think most people in the occupied territories and Israel are on that team if given the chance, same as they were in 1982 or 1994. We just can't ever give up.

Of course Israel has a right to exist and should remain. But of course the Palestinians also deserve freedom and dignity. Whoever can't accept that simple equation isn't on the side of humanity.

7675,"Shalom, well said brother. I am an American. There is an insidious amount of foreign propaganda poisoning the West and our social networks and not everyone can defend themselves against it. 

This is why our gays and liberals find themselves deceived into supporting Palestine. A poor/disenfranchised/scared liberal is easier to program into being anti-establishment. They live in a capitalist country, enjoy the benefits of capitalism (maybe not as much as others) yet reject capitalism in favor if this fantasy of a Marxist state, where they will be crushed tenfold what they are experiencing now.

This is why our Christian conservatives don’t support Ukraine and I even dare say some support Putin. A poor/disenfranchised/scared conservative is easier to program into being pro-Russian invasion. They claim to be patriots and defenders of the Constitution yet try to sneak the tendrils of their religion across the barriers between church and state at every turn, contrary to what our Constitution says. How they find themselves supporting Putin is as a mystery to you as it is me. He is our greatest enemy since the Cold War.

We ask for help too, our country is embattled from all sides. Every nation sends their bots to fight their social media wars on our networks. We need support in protecting our networks from foreign propaganda. If our own government can’t protect our borders online, we must rely on our allies to speak Reason and Truth. We must drown out the voices of our enemies with our own and only then can we all enjoy this Enlightenment together as we bring more of our people back to the light.

We see Hamas and Palestinians for what they are, they are one and the same - a bitter, violent people, led astray by a false god, and their day of judgement has come. They are nazis in my eyes and deserve to be brought to heel before they cause any more suffering to their own people and those around them. Their religion is a copycat clone of your OG Abrahamic one.

Just watched the video of Abed Al Rachman Al Nassasra telling the Hamasniks in perfect Arabic: “I’m a Palestinian Muslim from WB!”. His family thought he was abducted to Gaza. His burnt up corpse was just found. Just another example of Hamas’s “no particular plan, just murder, rape, destroy.” In the video where they captured him, they still hadn’t decided what to do to him. I wonder what made the Hamasniks conclude that they ought to immediately execute their unarmed, Palestinian, Muslim captive. I hope God had mercy on him, that he was dead before they set him on fire. 

I have Arab colleagues and friends, some from WB, others from Jerusalem, Galilee. Peace lovers. Life lovers. I’m honored to know each of them. They’re just as shocked and disgusted by Hamas people like everyone else. They’re also afraid of Israeli aggression, because Hamas is giving all Arabs a reputation of murderers and rapists.

**The only peaceful people who still support Hamas at this point are just still uninformed.**

I fully agree with the government’s declared goals, and hope they achieve them with as few casualties as possible:

1) Get the hostages back

2) Get any/all weapons out of Hamas’s hands

The first 2 are non-negotiable. The last one is really up to the Palestinians. 

3) Support any alternative gov the Palestinians want to raise in place of Hamas — hopefully a gov skilled (other than killing) and caring (other than for cash and death)

7686,"The difficulty Israel has here is that this is not a war for territory, or over some resolvable grievance.  For Israel (and for Jews worldwide, whether or not they recognize it), it is existential.  It is existential for all non-Muslims too - we're just lower on the list of targets than Jews.

The Palestinians are just the tip of the spear - they're the neighbors of Israel, so they get to be the point of contact for the Qur'an's instructions to kill all Jews.

""It isn't all Palestinians"".  That's true - there are some very young children who aren't old enough to understand yet.  The rest understand quite well.  How could they not?  The Palestinian territories have geared their entire culture toward producing terrorists whose primary goal is the murder of every Jew everywhere.  The ones in Israel are just first because they're closest.  Non-Jews will follow later (Hamas is on record as saying they intend to come after the rest of us).

Much of the foreign aid sent to the Palestinians is siphoned off to build infrastructure for terrorists, and weapons.  Palestinian schools teach children to be terrorists.  Their children's TV programming teaches young children to kill Jews.  They have telethons for the families of terrorists, and pensions that are higher than the average income are paid to the surviving families of terrorists.  Schools, mosques, refugee camps and hospitals are used as military headquarters, ammo dumps, and staging points for attacks; ambulances are used to transport terrorist strike teams, missile launchers camouflaged as garbage trucks fire from densely populated civilian areas, and apartments in crowded civilian areas become bomb factories.  The 2006 election that Hamas won wasn't a choice between terrorism and non-terrorism.  It was a choice between two different terrorist organizations.  Non-terrorism wasn't even on the menu.

So now, the government of Gaza has started a war - and it did so by sending its military to commit a laundry list of war crimes explicitly against civilians.  ...and Gazan ""civilians"" followed behind and did more.

Some apologists are saying ""this is no longer self-defense"".  ...and they're right.  It isn't.  It is a war that Hamas started, and Israel is going to finish - much as WWII was a war that the Axis started, and the Allies finished.  WWII stopped being ""self defense"" once the Axis powers were pushed back to their own borders - but the allies didn't stop then, because the war wasn't over.  They didn't stop when they had proportionately killed as many Germans, Italians, and Japanese as had been killed by Axis forces.  ""Proportionality"" is a ridiculous argument.  The allies didn't stop when civilians were killed in bombing campaigns.  They were hitting legitimate military targets, and the civilians were collateral damage.  They didn't stop when German soldiers used civilians as ""human shields"" during the Battle of Berlin.  Committing war crimes by using human shields or using protected civilian objects for military purposes does not render your forces immune from attack.  It just means that more civilians die when the enemy attacks the legitimate military targets.  That's why using civilians or civilian objects for military purposes is a war crime - it removes their protection.

The leaders of Hamas - safe in their mansions in Qatar - [understand how wars work](https://twitter.com/IsraelinUSA/status/1718021899056210213).  Wars are started by governments and fought by soldiers, but the civilian population decides when they end.  Wars don't end when one side wins all the battles, or captures all the objectives, they don't end when one side kills all the enemy soldiers, and they don't end even when the political leadership surrenders.  They end when the civilian population on one side decides that the *idea* of *one more day of war* is so horrible that they will do anything, give up anything to make it stop.  If they haven't, then when you kill all their soldiers, they'll make more.  When their political leadership surrenders, they'll be replaced with ones who still believe.  When all the military objectives are captured - up to and including the entire land area... they will become guerillas.  Until the civilians stop believing in the war, it will never end as long as they are alive.  ...and the Palestinians have been turned into fanatics who believe that all Jews must die and any action and any cost to achieve that is acceptable.

If Israel succeeds in killing 99.9% of the Hamas terrorist fighters in Gaza, the Gazan birth rate means that 50,000 more will be old enough to take up arms next year.  ...and 50,000 more the year after that.

That's the problem that Israel has to overcome.  The solution is to bomb Gaza to rubble, to prosecute and execute any survivors who are members of terrorist organizations or found to have been involved in the October 7 attacks, deport everyone else, and annex Gaza.  If they want to be particularly humane about it, take any orphans 5 years old or younger, place them with foster families, and deprogram them from terrorism and Islam.

Why annex Gaza and deport the remaining population?  Because simply killing the people involved is not enough.  They claim they are doing this for land - and are willing to die for that.  Dying isn't a punishment for someone who believes they are going to paradise for killing you, and they're not going to accept any other solution.  So, make their actions make their goal less achievable.  Every time they kill an Israeli, take more of their land and expel them from it.

I want you to think about who the ""You"" is that you refer to when you say, ""You don't like it now?""   If you are referring to Hamas, you are correct.  Their strategy is to provoke the Israelis into a reaction, and then use that reaction as further evidence that the Israelis are evil.  And as I'm sure you have seen, this strategy has been very successful.

But when you ask, ""You don't like it now?""  I hope you take a moment to realize that Hamas is not Palestine, and there are many people in Palestine who did not ask for this.

I don’t have the heart or the emotional space to grieve for our families, our children, our kidnapped hostages- and feel pain for the poor innocent Palestinian child.

And this is a problem.  Compassion fatigue is a common side effect of witnessing this much horror, as is dehumanization of people we consider our enemies.  This is how war crimes happen.  People are so angry and cling so tightly to their self-righteousness that they forget the people on the other side are human.  

Please keep in mind that Hamas is only one faction among the Palestinians, and some of those factions are nonviolent and cooperative.  The Palestinian Authority, for example, is criticized among Palestinians for being *too* cooperative.  And Netanyahu deliberately shunned these organizations and supported Hamas in order to sow division among the Palestinians.  

And as much as you claim the Israeli are ""defending their homeland,"" there are plenty of examples of Israeli terrorism targeting Palestinians (such as so-called 'settlers' in the West Bank) that are completely ignored.  There are Palestinians who were thrown out of their homes by Israelis within living memory.  These decisions on the part of the Israelis have created a sentiment that both sides are defending their homes to the death against the other.

First, I am a pretty good study of the Old testament. So I know all about the Jewish people leaving Israel due to drought and being enslaved and mistreated by Pharaohs. The crossing of the Red Sea, fighting the Amalekites and wandering in the wilderness.

Now, how did the Jewish people who I know thought they were Gods chosen and he promised them the land ended up in Israel battles.

Correct me if I am wrong, the Jewish Diaspora scattered the Jewish people everywhere on earth.It seems prior to the Awful Holocaust, the Jewish people were happy in other places.

Prior to WWII was Israel not called Palestine? But President Truman in 1947 allowed  100,000 Jewish people to immigrate back to Israel.  

It seems this started all the problems.  I have to ask why werethe Jewish people not on that land prior to WWII?

A great deal of Jewish people migrated to the U.S. after this.  I am trying to understand why Israel could go back and take the land from Palenstinian people.

I hope you do not take offense to my asking this.  I wish all the killing of innocent people would stop. 

Hamas is dreadful. The Bible says 'there will be wars and rumors of wars'.  Hamas should be driven out, but the killing of innocent people is hurtful to the world.

How many Palestinians should die to make Israel stop bombing innocent people who are among the treacherous Hamas.  Would 20000, 50000, 100000.  What's the number to say it's enough.

It's not very complicated. Even your founder agrees that there is no 'logic' in what you did.

> ""I don't understand your optimism."" Ben-Gurion declared. ""Why should the Arabs make peace? If I was an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country. Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. We come from Israel, it's true, but two thousand years ago, and what is that to them? There has been anti-Semitism the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country. Why should they accept that? They may perhaps forget in one or two generations' time, but for the moment there is no chance. So it's simple: we have to stay strong and maintain a powerful army. Our whole policy is there. Otherwise the Arabs will wipe us out"".

Or does simply nobody cares and is it so much simpler to blame it all on Israel and feed the world with more lies for further uprises of hurtful Muslims around the world that a ‘brother’ or ‘sister’ got killed by a Jewish rocket or bomb? When do the Gaza residents understand that with further supporting Hamas the situation only will worsen? The Palestinians in Gaza need to free themselves from Hamas and develop a more stable and democratic prosperous system. Free from Iran, free from Qatar, free from Hezbollah and also free from religion. Playing the victim card over and over again will never bring a (sustainable) solution! You need to be able to look at your own mistakes, misjudgments and shortcomings, and also religion, before you are able to improve.

7819,What about the +20 hospitals Israel blew in the last 10 years? I guess that's hamas too,2023-10-22 18:39:47
7820,"Maybe. 

On the other hand, imagine being the reporters in Gaza. 

You might have been educated in the West, or by reporters educated in the West. You dream of working for the BBC. You’re underpaid. You’re always terrified of getting in trouble for making a mistake or getting let go because traffic is down. And everyone sort of blames you when the news gets repetitive and a bit boring. 

Then you go to Gaza, and Israel’s now bombing you all the time. 

You’re eating bad food and can’t get good coffee. 

Your phone stopped working well. You can barely call people, let along search Google. 

Even though you might be a 50th generation Gazan, you’re also terrified of Hamas, even if your brothers are all Hamas generals. If your brothers are all Hamas generals, they think you’re a loser because you’re a reporter. 

Your access to information, food, shelter and communications depends almost entirely on Hamas. 

And the people in the hospitals are the closest thing to rational people you can talk to. Maybe they hate Israel, but they’re also mostly rational people who know that a lot of Jewish doctors have done useful things. And they can say interesting things that make sense. 

Then a hospital near you blows up around the same time Israeli missiles are blowing up other things. Everyone, including the Hamas spokespeople you’re supposed to quote, assumes Israel did it. Even plenty of Israelis can see that it’s possible that Israel did it.

And war is hell and terrible things often happen during war. The United States, for example, destroyed a bunker with 2,000 civilians in it, and that was such low-priority news I can’t remember whether the bunker was in Iraq or Afghanistan. 

So, it’s completely understandable how reporters reporting from Gaza and the editors getting the reports on the day this happened might have seen the situation differently than we do. 

And, for Al Jazeera editors, one priority has to be keeping the reporters in Gaza alive, and that might involve being very polite to Hamas. 

So, it’s reasonable for us to critique Al Jazeera’s accuracy here, but I think it’s wrong to be super harsh about it. Those reporters are doing a heroic job just by getting articles and picture out. They may actually be giving Israeli intelligence agencies and other sympathetic intelligence agencies glimpses of things the agencies couldn’t learn about any other way.",2023-10-22 13:05:06

I’d also like to remind that in case anyone didnt know.. other hospitals have been targeted before and throughout the years, and theyve sent warnings to evacuate that hospital before the strike. Channels like WSJ or any media channel that works for a country thats supporting israel will show you biased information like theyve done many many many times. Dont be easily fooled by what they show you and remember that a lot of things they claimed they didnt do over the years, have been claimed by the idf later on, like the American Palestinian journalist that was sniped.

It started with a socialist idea: unite the working class. Show up at coal miner strikes and stuff. Then ""the working class"" got generalized to anyone low in any hierarchy: gays, women, black people, and more recently, the West v. the Global South.

So how did Israel, a nation of refugees fleeing The Middle East, Europe, and Africa to their ancestral homeland, become all-powerful, colonizing, ""The West""? The Soviets were the ones who started the rumor about Jews being a secret Western force, back when ""West"" meant U.S. rather than Soviet. So the Soviets attacked the Jews and forced them to flee to Israel. Then the Soviets wanted to expand their sphere of influence into the Muslim world, so they funded Arab revolts against Israel. Both Soviets and Arabs considered Jews ""evil Westerners"" who should go back to where they came from. The Russians wanted the Jews to go back to Israel, and the Arabs wanted Jews to go back to Russia.

The Muslim world of course considers itself part of the Global South that has been humiliated by the West. They blame Israel for the West because 1) their friends the Soviets called the Jews ""evil Westerners"" 2) Muslims consider a Jewish country a humiliation to Islam, since Jews are supposed to live as dhimmis under Muslim rule. So it was easy for the Muslim world to call Jews ""Western oppressors,"" and the far left just bought it without looking into any of this.

By the way, Hamas actually talks about the Elders of Zion, the Russian Bible of Antisemitism basically, in their charter. Their charter goes on for paragraphs with old Russian conspiracy theories about Jews.

7880,"I'm with you. I'm far left but I kinda feel orphan these days given how delusional the political base and the far left candidates in my country proved themselves to be regarding this conflict. I think most leftists, progressives and other queers for Palestine legit talk in theory and did not take the time to see the reality.

They sure as hell did not read this page, on the [Islamisation of the Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism_in_the_Gaza_Strip) since Hamas took over, and what they're supporting to spread all over the land now. This makes it only clearer to me that if you truly want Palestinians to be free, that includes freeing them from their extremists overlord imposing Sharia on them.

By the same token, I did not entirely sniff glue and also do not support Netanyahu's far right wing gov and everything they did, aside now going to war after the horrific attack and to defend Israel's existence.

And to answer your questions, they're not outrage because they don't care about the population, and certainly won't when they won't be pushed up their feed. Just like all the peace loving children whining about America's war crimes in Afghanistan do not give one shit about women losing rights there under Taliban rule. They don't care either that Afghan refugees are being sent back now from Pakistan there.

7893,"I was thrown out of a popular left wing sub shortly after the Hamas attacks last month because I expressed distaste at the murder of Israeli civilians. It was a huge eye-opener for me as, while I knew that the subreddit in question had a pro-Palestine bias, I really didn't think that I said anything controversial (in fact the comment that got me banned was upvoted).

Since then I've maintained a general support for Palestine, partly fuelled by the horrific scenes of the war, but also because I've repeatedly been told by the left about how Palestinians have been persecuted and marginalised by Israel over the past 75 years.

But what I've come to realise is that I'm actually pretty ignorant on the subject. I'm trying to educate myself on the history of the region, but it's difficult as every source seems to be pushing an agenda. Some people will tell you about the atrocities of the ""Nakba"", but will fail to mention that the 1947 civil war was started by Arabs murdering Jewish civilians in response to being offered their own state by the UN. Others will tell you all about how the Palestinians have repeatedly refused the offer of a two-state solution, while sweeping the treatment of Palestinians in Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the rug.

I still haven't fully figured out where I stand in this conflict, but I'm trying to educate myself as best as I can.

But back to the ""Left"". Israel has grown into a formidable power and Palestine are seen as the underdogs. I think that a lot of people don't take the time to educate themselves properly and simply see it as the good guys vs the bad guys. And when they do try to educate themselves, those on the left (especially on Reddit) turn to their echo chambers who tell them about all the bad things Israel have done, while downplaying and making excuses for the monstrous actions of groups like Hamas, who are (to them) just blameless freedom fighters.

It ends in a seemingly hypocritical state of affairs whereby the ""left"" now support an organisation who openly support ethnic cleansing. Who throw LGBT people off of rooftops. Who want to create a theocratical ethnostate. All things that leftists claim to be against.

There have always been Jews in the region currently known as Israel, yet the average uninformed ""leftist"" will tell you that all Jewish Israelis are ""settlers"" or ""colonisers"" who have stolen the land. Yes, the Jewish population grew after WWII, but the Jews who came in weren't colonisers, they were refugees. The same ""leftists"" are usually pro-refugee rights when it comes to anywhere else in the world.

One final point on the hypocrisy of the Reddit ""left"". A lot of the left-wing echo chambers will tell you not to support Ukraine, who are quite literally fighting off a foreign invader, because of the existence of groups such as the Azov battalion. The very same people will brush aside the atrocities committed by Hamas and say ""they're just fighting for their freedom"". Total hypocrisy.",2023-11-16 10:34:11

7898," Ah, so interesting. The reason is because, while all of those things you mention are left wing or progressive INSIDE of the West, the overarching structure of left-wing belief for at least a century (but especially over the last 50 years) is that the West oppresses other societies/cultures. That's the main pillar of left wing thought -- that the rest of the world is poor, distressed, conflict-ridden, etc. because of the West. 

So this gets left wing people into a huge pickle when these things come into conflict. Islamic societies typically deprive women of equal rights, for example, but the left doesn't talk about that much because it would seem to be ""interfering"" in non-Western societies. That's why Margaret Atwood writes The Handmaid's Tale about the United States and not about the Islamic world, which would be far, far more appropriate and relevant. And this division/contradiction extends to a million different things. You've pointed out some of them yourself. Left-wing people regret and disapprove of regressive practices in other countries, but they can never truly bring themselves to critique them the way they deserve to be critiqued (which is harshly). It would be too ""imperialist,"" ""ethnocentric"" or whatever to do so. 

They're much more likely to claim that the mistreatment of people in other societies is BECAUSE of the West, i.e. the West screwed them up. So that's why, while Hamas has a belief system right out of the Middle Ages, is barbaric in its behavior, and hates anything the left in the West might approve of, it still gets something of a pass, because it's representing the interests of a (supposedly) oppressed non-Western population. And Israel, obviously, is seen as a bastion of Western liberalism.",2023-11-16 00:30:43

It was always seen as a natural fit and the American labor movement was staunchly Zionist, being largely founded by areligious, leftist American Jews, just as Israel was founded by areligious Jews from Europe and other Western countries.  
Where the schism originated was that all of this was always at odds with international Communist movements. As for them, the afore-mentioned Soviet-influenced international left survived and indeed was invigorated following the fall of the USSR. Perhaps the USSR was hypocritical baggage for that international left. Anyway... that international left was very majoritarian in character, and it's also very anti-Western values for the simple reason that those values allowed the West to prevail over international Communism.

Israel has violated more than 30 UN resolutions and has been accused of war crimes for decades. 

Palestinians who live in the West Bank live under a military occupation and therefore face military courts, whereas Israeli settlers who live on illegal settlements built on the SAME land are subject to Israeli civil and criminal law.

They blackmail people in the lgbt community to be spies. These are just some examples but you can look more into how Palestinians are being treated.

While Israel is still marginally justified to defend itself, there is no denying Israel has prodded Palestine into a corner and is enjoying playing off the response that Palestine answered to continued Israeli encroachment onto more and more of their land.

The reason many Leftists are siding with Palestine (NOT HAMAS) is because the tactics used by Israel to gain this victim status and justify further retaliation against Palestine are eerily reminiscent of right-wing playbook tactics, especially the ones Hitler used to justify invading Czechoslovakia.

Israel is a member of the United Nations, an ally of the West and the self-proclaimed Chosen People. They should be held to a higher standard. In fighting terrorists, they should take care not to adopt the tactics of terror. Israel should be the bigger person in the room and negotiate a ceasefire, not escalate the tensions through blockades and continued bombing of public infrastructure for the sake of nabbing a few terrorists here and there. Yes, Palestinians are using guerilla tactics, but that's the price of the dance. If Israel wants to stay on its land in peace, it must be prepared to cuddle the cornered dog, no matter how hard it bites back. Israel's responses to Palestinian resistance so far has been akin to a grown man dropkicking a child that spat paper wads at them.

Palestinians, on the other hand, bear the responsibility to demand a new representative government other than Hamas, but the reality is that Hamas will kill any internal opposition and has the entire people at gunpoint. Israel should realize this and work more subtly to take down Hamas (with, say, fly-sized drones that assassinate with potent neurotoxins, instead of striking buildings at random) instead of taking advantage of inner turmoil and using Hamas as an excuse to further expand into Palestinian territory.

Israel is a legitimate government, not a terrorist state. It has the responsibility to play by the rules, even when its opponent is not. They have the power to end this very quickly and with minimal casualties, yet they continue to choose hate. It should be no surprise that many leftists foolishly choose to side with Hamas.

Protestant christians have no concept of a home base for our different religions within protestant christianity, so its a weird concept for us.

And even with the vatican, its location isnt special or anything, It just happened to be there over time. No one makes pilgrimages like jewish and muslim people do. Its a big religious office for the catholics as far as most protestants are concerned lol. 

I think this makes it weird for a lot of protestant christians to  try to understand this stuff. We have no concept of a home base. So we cant empathize with losing something like that. If you lose it, just make a new one? Obviously I wouldnt suggest that, but like, idk what else to do lol. If we lost the vatican, the art and texts inside would be more devastating than the actual building. No one would care about the religious symbolism of the building if no one was hurt and no art/scripture lost. We can just make a new one, doesnt even need to be in the same spot.

We also have a history of disagreeing on which christian capitol is the REAL one lol. We had 3 different popes at once. Now we just dont care.

Now, catholics might not agree with me on that though lol, but they also dont make any pilgrimage to the vatican unless they are wealthy enough to travel in the first place. No one does it to specifically fulfil religious things.

Go check the sources he is using and you will find your way.

8037,"Yes you are right. 

But what a lot of people understand from this conflict is that Israel is still occupying parts of what should ideally be a Palestinian territory. That while they went out of Gaza, they still didn't get out of other territories (which clearly isn't the totality of Israel).

A lot of people don't understand that the Hamas wants to free ALL of Israel from its people using violence if necessary. A lot of people want to naively believe that the Hamas somewhat represent all the Palestinian people and that they actually care about their citizens (they don't).

Some people think they need to take a side even if they don't know anything about the conflict (reading a few internet pages isn't what I call ""knowing about the conflict"". So people are seeing two things:

One side who seem to fight against an oppressor (Israel) which is only partially true, because Israel also has to protect itself from regular attacks (Hamas, Hezbollah etc.)

They see one army (claimed stronger), not always true especially in the case of 7th of October but there have been many times where other people were kidnapped, killed etc so not always perfectly able to protect its people from aggression.

On the other hand, they see people crying between rumbles of broken houses.

Not saying that's all there is but that's what you see when you only scratch the surface.


Based on that, people make an opinion and because they believe there is a side to take, they do take the side which seems the most obvious even if in reality, it isn't that simple...at all.

Can you fathom the depths of despair as they record these horrors, laughing and celebrating the suffering they inflict, their actions devoid of humanity? Does the imagery of women, children, and the elderly, victims of violence and brutality, tear at your soul?

And then, consider the unspeakable, the concept of rape and abduction amidst this chaos. Does it shatter your faith in the innate goodness of humanity to contemplate such atrocities?

As they force their hostages to share their torment with the world, does it strike you that empathy has been replaced with cruelty, that the human spirit can be driven to such depths?

Imagine the procession through Jerusalem, where victims are paraded, innocence laid bare, only to be met with scorn and jubilation. Does it fill you with despair for our collective conscience, that such hatred and cruelty could find a place within us?

And when they seek justice, only to be met with denial, how does it make you feel? Does it lead to a sense of frustration, a bitter understanding of how complexities can overshadow the most glaring injustices?

How frustrated would you be for humanity? I assume a lot more frustrated than you are now, with Palestinians in the open air prison.

That said, the worldwide anti-semitism we are seeing on our screens every day recently and on our streets is abhorrent!  I’ve wondered why more Muslims, especially those living in western countries, don’t have a similar take on the racism.  I don’t hate anyone because of their religion, why do almost all Muslims and Arabs hate all Jews without knowing anything about the individuals, and we are also seeing that hatred spilling into the ideologies of so many westerners and Europeans.  I’m baffled by that.  Surely Jews in Australia, America, Europe, etc are not responsible for anything Muslims consider Israel has done wrong, so why hate them, and worse, want them dead? 

It is refreshing to read that not all Muslims think alike, some are able to think logically through the issues and form their own opinion.  Here are some links a Jewish mate of mine sent me, to interesting clips of other Muslims with similar opinions re the conflict to those of u/kalminator87 - 2 are of Muslim-Israelis, 1 is a former Hamas member (the son of one of the founders of Hamas), and 1 is a Muslim who was a radical Hamas supporter but now sides with Israel.

I appreciate that all religions have extremists at both ends, those who reject the general beliefs and those who would kill to support them, but I think the views in these clips are not extremist.

The things you say are generally true but the message that the uneducated reader gets is arabs are „bad humans“. All the things you (rightfully) criticize about arabs today have been true for every ethnicity, there is just some exceptions that managed to overcome some of those problems in the last 200 years.

Back in the day, europeans killed the most europeans, native americans killed the most native americans, africans killed the most africans and so on. That has not much to do with ethnicity again but with the humans struggle for power - it‘s easier to take power from your neighbor than from somebody far away and unknown. 
We all treated women badly, married them off as children, we all did have little regard for human life.

Ethnicity is not the difference here. There is other reasons some parts of the human population have managed to overcome, the most important are education, a higher standard of living, better medical care, more democratic representation and economic opportunity.

So you made the first step by not putting the blame on israelis or jews or the west and I commend you for that. Now the next step is to understand that arabs are not more at fault - people are often simply a product of their environment.

So if we really want to change something that is what we have to change and that means the responsibility is with everybody that CAN do something to help. That includes arabs as well as the west and Israel.",2023-11-23 13:42:00

Mainstream Zionists, represented by the Vaad Leumi and the Haganah, practiced the policy of Havlagah (restraint); Irgun militants did not follow this policy and called themselves ""Havlagah breakers.""[9] The Irgun began bombing Palestinian Arab civilian targets in 1938.[6] While the Palestinian Arabs were ""carefully disarmed"" by the British Mandatory authorities by 1939, the Zionists were not.[6] As a conciliation to the Arabs, the White Paper of 1939 was passed, imposing significant limits in Jewish immigration in the shadow of World War II.",2023-10-11 10:27:16

Israel may seem like a rich well armed western power, but it’s a small country and has a relatively small ground force.  It can’t just lose 5000 or 10000 soldiers like it’s nothing.  Israel isn’t going to risk its soldiers or civilians lives to have the “moral high ground.”   It can’t afford to, and it has no will to after 10/7.   Assymetric urban warfare is deadly for conventional ground forces, so Israel is doing what it can to devastate hamas’s capabilities from the air and by siege first.

8433,"When people say “free Palestine,” they are not calling for the killing or displacement of Jews. Rather, it is a simple plea to end Palestinian suffering. Consider this:

Israel currently has over 100 settlements in territories designated to Palestine by the U.N., and any protest from the Palestinians against the Israeli authorities bulldozing/redistributing their homes was either ignored or met with violence.  

The Israeli defense force has checkpoints and outposts all around Gaza and have tight control over several border crossings, meaning Palestinians cannot simply just get up and leave. Rather, the Palestinians are forced to stay in a strip of land roughly the size of Philadelphia but with a third more people, and do not even have control over their own water or electricity.  

Hamas was “voted” into power in 2006 (44% voted in favor of the Hamas), yet nearly two thirds of the current population in Gaza are under the age of 24. This means that the VAST majority of Palestinians alive today residing in Gaza were either children, or had not even been born yet when the elections took place. These people clearly had no say in Hamas’ vote into power, yet are held responsible for their atrocities.

8465,"What’s scary is the generalizations Israelis make about Palestinians and the use these generalizations to justify their war crimes. Cutting off water to 2.2 million civilians is ok, they say, because they want “to kill or displace every Israeli.” This is obviously not true, most Palestinians want peace and equal access to housing and markets in Tel Aviv. But it is interesting that people say “kill or displace every Israeli” considering in the Nakba in 1948, the Jews killed and displaced the native Palestinian people and put them in camps with fences and military guards. They live in Gaza because they were forced to live there and are under complete economic, military, and basic resource control by Israel, simply on the basis of religion, ethnicity, and skin color. This is apartheid. 

I am a supporter of Palestinian equal rights in a secular, democratic Israel. Theocratic-ethnostates are diametrically opposed to my values growing up as a minority religious group in a pluralistic society. The one state solution is almost never discussed but it is the solution of MLK and Nelson Mandela. Killing civilians is never justified but Israel is using classic war propaganda techniques (40 beheaded babies, they are human animals, every civilian we kill is a human shield so we have no choice). All of these are proven falsehoods, though every civilian killed is an atrocity. 

If I were in Israeli politics, I would 1. Evacuate every child under the age of 10 from Gaza into Israel with their mothers. 2. Individually vet every man and woman in Rafah to make sure they didn’t kill civilians and are not interested in attacking again in the future. 3. Kill or apprehend Hamas 4. Grant full rights as Israeli citizens to any Palestinian who wants it (this is not a negotiation with Hamas or the PA but with individuals.) 5. Reparations for Palestinians who lost the possibility of generational wealth through housing programs and basic income.

They set up check points to restrict people’s movement and found a way to control provision of water, electricity and all supplies to Palestinians. For good measure they also restricted how far fishermen can fish in Palestinian waters, lest they prosper. Adding insult to injury, Israel set up settlements in Gaza (against international law) and scarcely populated them with Israelis who took over Palestinian land. Finally, for good measure, they denied Palestinians the most basic rights, thus creating for Hamas a huge recruitment pool of youth with nothing to lose. Palestinians are daily harassed by the IDF and subject to constant restrictions in their daily lives, including imprisonment of minors without due representation or cause.
Given the lack of political agency, violence fills the gap and Hamas shoots missiles into Israel killing innocent civilians. IDF then retaliates in the disproportion of 100 bombs for each rocket or stone thrown - disproportionate response is a war crime. Given the disproportionate response by the IDF into highly populated areas, they are bound to hit schools and hospitals and to kill disproportionate innocent civilians. But you know what? Never mind!

Hence, innocent civilians being murdered by the IDF are just war casualties, another bright idea of the propaganda machine.

Palestinians will eventually be able to vote.

At the current situation in gaza, Israel is bombing everything, don't whitewash the atrocities claiming without proof hamas is shooting rockets from there. It's literally impossible to defend dropping more bombs on gaza than rockets actually fired, at the moment there are more buildings destroyed by Israel than actual number of rockets fired, so even if hamas fired one single rocket from (somehow) within a building, Israel has already bombed more buildings than rockets, not to mention hamas fires dozens or hundreds of rockets from the same location, so from your logic Israel was supposed to destroy 50 buildings. Nooot to mention destroyed buildings are a perfect spot to shoot rockets from.

The amount of Palestinian civilians killed in the current war by Israel faaar exceed hamas fighters, not to mention that literally 50% of the population of Gaza are children, and you can't really treat children as adults.

You are completely, and utterly ignoring the absolute fact and truth, that the majority of these kids lived their entire life under Israeli blockade and siege, they have no interaction with outside world, you literally, want them, these kids, to have the logic to see hamas as the people oppressing them, when they have never even tasted what life is?

Israel, is, committing, war crimes. Cutting water, food, electricity, from all the civilian population of gaza is literally a war crime. Don't tell me hamas, stop hiding behind hamas. Israeli government and military actions are hurting civilians not hamas.

&#x200B;

>They think everything is a genocide while never bothering to look up the definition.

 Genocide is an internationally recognized crime where acts are committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. This is the definition. What's Israel doing? If we look at the statistics of killed Palestinians and Israelis, and the map of Palestine over the past half century, there's no debating it, it's not even just a genocide, it's ethnic cleansing. If you google ""*The Human Cost Of The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict*"", you'll see the statistics yourself. When you see something like 130 dead Israelis for 31588 dead Palestinians, there's nothing you can say to justify it. Don't even try.

&#x200B;

> They call Israel an apartheid state while also having no clue what it means. 

It means separating two difference races/ethnicities for no other reason than their race, splitting them up not only geographically, but also giving more rights to one race and less to the other. That's not what Israel has done and is still doing? Have you seen how people live in Gaza? How Israel is limiting their water supply, their electricity, hell, even their borders, they can't leave, humanitarians can't enter, and if they try, they get killed, like the aid ship that was raided by Israeli ""soldiers"" (why not call them terrorists btw?) and all 9 crew men were killed, including an American. They don't want anybody helping Palestine, nothing/nobody in or out.

&#x200B;

>When you're firing rockets from a school, that school becomes a military target.

By that logic, when Israel makes military service mandatory, which it is, and that all people over 18 years old are forced to enlist, anybody over 18 is a military target. That's your logic right there. If you say this, you say that.

&#x200B;

>though they never bring up any actual examples

Examples of Israeli war crimes? There are so many, except that the western medias don't label them as such, they're called collateral damage. When Israel bombs residential areas, and children die, it's collateral damage, always. Hamas doesn't own or have influence over large media firms like Israel/US do.

Then you also said :

>They demand to see footage of dead babies and raped women, even though it shouldn't need to get proven that an organisation that calls for the death of all Jews is absolutely barbaric.

Hamas and their sponsors in Iran have no tactical superiority at all.  They fight with terrorism and rely on propaganda to placate their barbaric, savage, antisemitic ways, especially for securing funding.  Hamas’ vile hatred is a cancer.  But their propaganda front and related regional radical islamic-jihad terror cells is substantial.  

Violence and terror is a part of their tactics.  Turn the propaganda war, and Hamas is toast.

The hospital bombing media disaster showed to free thinking critics the world over that the BBC, the NYT and many legacy media conglomerates are compromised in their reporting.  Ultimately, their capacity to placate propaganda as “news,” is in their best interest.

In a way, this conflict is really sustained only as far as the funding sources for opposing forces remains intact.  “Progressive” leftist media has effectively been trapped by clear-substantive evidence of war crimes- that HAMAS takes credit for.

The “debate” over Israel vs. Palestine is largely manufactured debate, synthesized by vested media interests who are largely told what to say and what not to say or they lose their job.  

The conflict is the IDF vs. Hamas.  Only morons jump on network media narratives to seem educated over the event without actually having been there or- (imo) worse- to align with some “morally” superior argument they hear that they tell themselves use to feel good and virtuous for following and aligning with, like sheep or pack animals that simply follow things to feel more secure.

Weak people make hard times.  Monsters of men and women are now “in charge” of the greatest killing technologies human history has even known: language.  Have faith that their propensity to promote war footage changes their valuation of life and death.

Support life, fight death.

Hamas, and radical islamic terrorism is satanic in my view.  Their valuation and organization of society based on the purpose of violence, death and abuse towards jews is a clear violation of the articles of the Geneva convention.

Any moral debates at this point are based from actors and pundits seeking views and followers as much as a civil debate or argument.  This is why liberal democrats are colloquially known as “libtards.”


edit: this is why I personally discriminate against liberal democrats (most exclusively in the USA) who pander to Hamas’ funding sources (aka pro-Palestine media coverage that has a vested interest to chase “credible” media sources that generate income- or at least they TRY to seem credible pushing what Hamas wants them to see.). “Libtards” is discriminatory by design but it should force a civil debate, I hope.  Language is a powerful weapon, almost as powerful as the forces behind the messengers 🙏💜

8647,"If Israel bombs Hamas targets in Gaza, it is recklessly endangering civilian life. But if it gives civilians fair warning to move away from certain areas, it is engaging in ethnic cleansing. If it drops bombs in built-up suburbs, it is committing a war crime. But if it advises civilians to leave those built-up suburbs before the bombs come, it is also committing a war crime. If it attacks northern Gaza, that’s genocide. Yet when it tells the civilians of northern Gaza to leave first, that’s ‘forced transfer’, which is to say: genocide.

Everything Israel does is a war crime. Everything. Killing civilians – war crime. Trying not to kill civilians – war crime. Bombing populated areas – war crime. Giving a population time to leave before dropping bombs – war crime. The surrealism of these screams of ‘genocide!’

‘Punish’ Palestinians and you’re a criminal. Do everything in your power to avoid ‘punishing’ Palestinians and you’re still a criminal. I’m starting to wish the Israel-haters would just say what they mean with their entire chest: ‘Let yourselves be killed, Jews. Don’t fight back. Don’t do anything at all.’

We need to say how unhinged this discussion has become. Evacuation and civilian casualties are a part of every war. Wars always cause waves of refugees and unfortunate civilian deaths. You probably have a few refugees from Ukraine, in your neighbourhood. And yet when it’s a war involving Israel, evacuation becomes ‘forced transfer’. The inevitable creation of refugees becomes ‘ethnic cleansing’. The movement of people away from destruction becomes the attempted destruction of those people. This is where we’re at: not killing people is genocide now, if the state not killing them is Israel.

It is a straight-up lie to say Israel is enacting genocide in Gaza. Genocide is the mass murder of an ethnic minority by a dominant majority determined to enjoy homogeneity across the realm. There is not one shred of evidence this is Israel’s intention. Nothing exists – literally nothing – to suggest Israel will murder an entire people because it wants to imprint its own supremacist ideology on their old towns and villages.

There’s a ‘sneaky Jew’ feel to the idea that under the cover of fairly normal wartime action, Israel is committing genocide. It is a vile calumny against a nation that just lost more than a thousand of its citizens to a genuinely genocidal movement to describe its response to that horror as genocidal.

The people whose kibbutzim were ethnically cleansed are insulted as ethnic cleansers. The nation that witnessed the annihilation of entire families is defamed as the annihilator. I see all these biased organisations with (not so well) hidden agendas talk about the sneakiness and wickedness of Israel as a mildly more sophisticated version of the utterances of the scumbags who have gathered in public to say ‘Aww, are your people dead?’ or who’ve said we should ‘Rejoice’ over Hamas’s slaughter.

8651,">Just to be clear, I think all civilian deaths on both sides are tragic

Just to be clear, every single death on October 7th, and since, is blood on the hands of Hamas and the supporters of Hamas.  There would be no tanks rolling through the streets of Gaza, no bombs falling, no buildings collapsed, no dead babies in the rubble, had Hamas not started a war in the streets of Gaza.  Hamas went for ONE day into Israel, raping women, burning whole families alive, butchering and beheading people, and abducting civilians to use for hostages, because they WANTED this war to be in Gaza.  That was the whole point of it, to draw the Palestinian population, the IDF, to the streets of Gaza and continue their reign of terror.  I too feel sympathy for a young daughter who is dead in the street, but if her father has joined Hamas, and turned her home into a battlefield, her death is blood on her father's hands.

Of course every civilian death is tragic, but that isn't ""both sides"" .. the Israeli and Palestinian people are united in ending Hamas.  Anyone who isn't, supports Hamas, those are the ""two sides"".  You are either pro future, or mired in the thinking of this death cult.

So it all depends upon the intentions. Is it Israel's intention to push out Palestinians into egypt? If so then it's genocide. Is it trying to slowly push Palestinians outside of the west-bank? If so then it's genocide.

Not every genocidal action is overtly violent. For example, one of the recognised categories of action is:  "" *Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part* "" . Things like Property Laws, restriction of movement, restriction of water, can all be used for this purpose.

Furthermore they cut water, food, fuel off to the entire population, not just Hamas. That is collective punishment which is also a war crime.

Hello I’m an American Israeli now before you start to hate me can you spare a minute to hear? I am not on a side, I do not support Israel or Palestinian 
Before you run and write I hate you because “you don’t support us” let me tell you a little about myself 
I’m 16 years old I was raised in the USA and now I live in Israel 
Look I’m not saying that I do know everything even the opposite actually I don’t know anything, my entire life was simply decided by birth and my surroundings 
I grew up reading simple books like Curious Goerge and I think I still have that side in me which in these days some people don’t really understand.
Even though I grew up optimistic there was a phase that I just didn’t fit in, I was alone (alone with my thoughts) weird kid that had depression and was afraid to go out to the world because I was afraid of everything afraid of the truth that the world just isn’t fair. I understood that maybe I won’t fit in into this gray world because my mind is still stuck in the colour books when I was 5 but slowly I accepted the fact that life is not fair.

Just recently I woke up to see my mama crying watching the media of my country, I usually don’t watch tv or anything like that but yes I’m not perfect so I too sometimes stuck in my little screen to avoid the unfairness that surrounds me. But from that moment that I saw my mama and my little brother that I love so much devastated from the tv my mind clicked, I felt like I was awakened or I just knew that now that my time is now on a countdown. 
You know I was never really religious I feel like I was just simply born into religion, yes I do believe, but not in a Jewish god or greek god or Allah nor science it’s just hope.
It’s been a couple days since this war began, everyday feels like my last, sometimes at night my eyes just won’t close because of the thought of all the tanks that were filled with tears on both sides and also because my big brother was sent to the army. 

today I ate a brownie I thought that there are also people in this world that never ate brownies which made me sad but I reminded myself that maybe today is my last and I know that sadness will only resort to no good. 
I’ve realised before this war that my biggest worry was my driving lessons and my yelling teacher because I wouldn’t understand where to stop when I see the stop sign and now that worry faded.
Now before that you go on with you life, do I deserve to die?  Am I at fault for simply living life but being born with Israeli parents? Am I responsible for my country doings? Does the kid that live in Gaza deserve to die? or live a life of poverty and hate and never eat brownies? 
All that I ask of you is to question so you can see both sides but it is hard I know I’ve been there but please for the sake of the future and morality be curious don’t be one sided and accept that yes life isn’t fair",2023-10-10 20:53:38

It’s so evil. How can you support anyone who does that? How can you excuse that level or barbarity? How can you just lie like that?

On top of that, I’m seeing SO much antise mitism it’s actually scary. They’re going as far as to pull out 1930s German race science. I’m so disgusted. I’ve never seen anything like it. I didn’t know racism like that even existed still. 

Lastly, these people are praising Islam and spreading false narratives about it being the least oppressive religion for women and lgbtq people, and the most peaceful religion. I’ve lived in the Middle East. I know firsthand how oppressive Islam is. Ive seen the awful things that are done to Muslim women. I know how much violence and chaos happens in its name. Of course, I don’t support hating or discriminating against Muslim people at all. But I will never support Islam as a religion, and I don’t see how any who claims to be progressive ever could. It’s disgusting that westerners are knowingly spreading false claims about how wonderful it is while people in muslim countries are being oppressed and killed every day because of it. And they’re supporting Islam and spreading those false claims just because it fits a political narrative they’re trying to push. 

I’m so incredibly thrown off by seeing people behave this way, especially since I would have considered myself politically aligned with most of them prior to this war. Now, I want nothing to do with them. They are bigots, racists, terrorist sympathizers, and liars. They have no morals or ethical standards. They aren’t supporting what’s right.

Even though they know I understand so many of their positions. But the entire pro Palestine movement is being tainted by this kind of QAnon thinking and misinformation. It’s terrifying. And more than that, it does feel like there’s no way back from this in interpersonal relationships. “This” being posting about how great Hamas is.

8785,"I agree, it’s nice to see none of this same rhetoric being said while I’m in public, as most of this weird fantasy in which people think the hostages were having a great time has mainly just been said in comment sections and tiktoks. 

But it’s absolutely crazy to me that there are legit people out there somewhere to think that just because a girl or mother was smiling and waving towards the crowds and camera is undeniable proof of them enjoying their time in captivity. It has obviously been shown through similar mannerisms of each of the released hostages (some of which haven’t been captive together for 50 days) to be not a coincidence and heavy signs of being rehearsed/instructed for public viewing before they were to be handed over. The subtle compliments to their captors, the almost robotic waves and smiles, the handshake as if we’ve ever seen that done with any hostage release situation. It’s all obviously instructed as Hamas has every reason to keep taking advantage of the public opinion as obviously their options are limited. And it’s clear their goal is to push a certain narrative that they were the good guys. Unfortunately for them, nice tiktok comments and building a brain rotted fan base on a social media app doesn’t win conflicts. 

Not even going to mention the obvious that many hostages still have friends and family captives, and even if they didn’t, as a citizen of Israel they all collectively agree to stay calm and collected to not give Hamas any reason to harm the their fellow countrymen. As it would definitely be stupid to immediately start insulting/speaking out publicly on a group still capable of small scale attacks on Israeli soil. 

And finally the saddest part as the days went on and mostly women and children were released and people were cheering hamas for keeping them in somewhat decent conditions physically. (As if that should be celebrated for doing the bare minimum of keeping your prisoners/hostages in good condition) No one seems to mention the evidence of the terrible crimes on the men that have been taken. And not just Israeli men, but workers/party goers from all over the world. Videos on telegram showing beaten and mentally abused thai men with assault rifles pointed at them in a taunting stance.

What if people believe that the prisoners being alive and not completely returned with burn marks, cuts by knives all over, broken bones in their faces, near death from complete neglect, or showing signs of sexual abuse is just them expressing gratitude and encouraging Hamas to treat the hostages with the utmost care and respect that people are believing is the standard since the released  hostages have shown remarkable resilience and no real outward signs of flagrant abuse? What if people are trying to inspire the families of the other hostages to not lose hope? 

The videos saying that a young teenager falling for her captor is some next level bs, and how wonderful their experience must have been with Hamas are Propaganda and not indicative of reality. They were kidnapped and held against their wishes. I am grateful they’ve been returned and I’m grateful that they aren’t in serious medical condition from the ordeal. It gives me hope that the others will be returned similarly. I also realize that not everyone who took captives was with Hamas that day. There were other terrorist cells and regular people that poured out and did things not under the orders of anyone. I’m sure Hamas had to hunt those captives down and “negotiate” with others to get those captives away and then put them in their safe house in order to negotiate with Israel.

It was already shown that they forget to cut out a ""keep waving"" command they were giving the freed hostage children as they were in the Red Cross car: https://x.com/avniyayin/status/1728572950507561437?s=08

And to be clear, even if Hamas treated them perfectly, and not subjected them to psychological and physical torture, it would still be an absolutely bonkers argument to make. No, they don't get credit for treating the toddlers you kidnapped for ransom well. No, the fact you want to exchange them for convicted or suspected terrorists, doesn't make it justified. No, it doesn't prove the mercy and humanity of Hamas, and the moral superiority of Arabs and Muslims. It proves quite the opposite.

And that's before we even started with the truly revolting gloating. The cruel jokes about how the children are sad because they have to eat disgusting Jew food, and not the correct Arab food. The super-popular memes about how the women and young girls were raped, and enjoyed it.

And of course, let's not forget the overwhelming atrocity denial and justifications.

I'm completely with you. The people making these jokes, these arguments, are in at the very bottom of a moral cesspit. The fact they openly post them, often with their real names, shows that it's not just a bunch of a-holes, but a deep systemic problem. Beyond disgusting.",2023-12-01 08:47:22

8806,"I agree completely. They are either knowing or recklessly sharing Hamas propaganda—part of me truly think there should be some type of responsibility for spreading the propaganda of a terrorist organization. 

The most obvious reason they would smile and wave is that they were told to do so. When you have been held hostage by a maniacal, murderous, genocidal, terrorist group, you do what you are told. Especially when they are still holding your friends and family members hostage, and you don’t want harm to come to them.

Let’s say for the sake of argument that they were treated “well” or whatever adjective they want to use. The fact is that Hamas indiscriminately murdered 1,200 civilians in cold blood, brutally raped women, beheaded people, and kidnapped 200 civilians. They then brought war upon the entire region are responsible for thousands of deaths of innocent people in Palestine because they hide behind civilians. They could have held them at a 5 star resort for all I care—they’re still monstrous war criminals.

Especially since we haven't yet heard much from the hostages themselves yet and probably won't for some time.

For people who insist the hostages were treated well: if you're right, cool! I don't see how that changes anything. It just shows that Hamas was acting responsibly in this particular instance.

For people who insist the hostages were treated horribly and inhumanely: that's pretty much what most of the world expected to be the case, so it doesn't really change much, does it?

What kind of human beings are you ? Hamas didnt go there Killing people for fun, the people who were there themselves admitted that there were an exchange of gunfire between hamas and the idf and that many israeli people who got killed there were actually shot by the idf themselves, they shot their own people to not let hamas take them as hostages.
You never wonder why you dont see these kind of things with the Palestinian hostages who are being released from prison ? Most of them got released with a mental illness, why ? Because they were torturing them and treating them worse than animals, meanwhile an israeli hostage left a message to hamas thanking them, and you all saw with your own eyes how nice they were to hamas, thanking them while having a genuine smiles on their faces, you still think that israel is the good guy ?

You behave the same way a german would accuse the partisans that there is no way they would treat a german citizen well. Its not because they are incapable of it, its because you are incapable of its comprehension because it forces you to humanise the other. Once you accept that Hamas is capable of doing the same evil as well as good as the israeli government, then there will be peace. That is the only thing we learn from history, the oppressor only speaks one language - violence, you are just surprised a shimmer of good snuck through the clouds of the airstrikes. Take a hard look in the mirror. 

Another point to make; why are Hamas required to treat their hostages well? Why can’t they return the same treatment that is being forced illegally upon children throwing stones at mirkavas? Why are they held to a higher standard of morality when that burden falls upon the nation with the nuclear arms? Who are you to tell us how to treat prisoners of war when you do not treat them well. Stop crying about it and accept what you don’t like. Accept that what you do to people can easily be done to you, dont be surprised if along the way we demonstrate better humanity than your violent pogroms and outrage. 

You strike me as a typical liberal zionist who incapable of comprehending matter of facts because mommy and daddy told you otherwise, and now when you see it you do not believe your own eyes.

But there's no evidence to suggest that they aren't being treated well. There's evidence to suggest the opposite, but no evidence of the contrary.

Hamas knows that it will lose a certain demographic of support if they mistreat hostages, so if they are treating hostages well, (which I tend to believe until any evidence of the contrary is presented) it wouldn't mean that they're people of good moral standing...

Leftists claim that Israel is an apartheid state, and that Palestinians are being genocided. American leftists have sympathy for this, mostly due to USA’s historic treatment of native Americans and other racial minorities.

Some groups and the institutions those groups created are bad, because they oppressed other groups of humans who are now disadvantaged.

Sometimes other groups of people are seen as somewhat oppressed, but also as oppressors, too. This would include Asians and Jews. Because Jews are seen as more 'white' and western compared to Palestinians, it would make sense that a western lefty would sympathize with the Palestinian cause over the security concerns of Israel.

Of course, the 'colonizers vs decolonizer' frame is also relevant. They see Israelies as people who came and took the land of indigenous Palestinians, and thus the Israelis are oppressors who must be opposed, even if it means turning a blind eye to the atrocities committed by Hamas.

That being said, I have been dumbfounded by the left’s reaction to these events, and feel quite alienated from the demographic I generally politically and ideologically align with—astounded that in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack it was not universally condemned as a terrorist attack, astounded that on the day Hamas called for a day of Jihad against Jewish people there were protests all over the world, astounded at how the media handled the bombed hospital, etc.  The list goes on. 

The super left always roots for the underdog.  For me, from a historical vantage point, Israel (and Jewish people) are the underdog. There are 16 million of them left on the planet. They’ve experienced genocide (not apartheid—genocide) time and time again. I believe Israel’s existence is imperative for the continuation of the Jewish faith/race. I believe in Israel’s right to defend itself against a terrorist organization that wants (per the Covenant of Hamas) to wipe Israel and all Jewish people off the planet.  To most of my demographic, Palestine is the underdog.  Which, of course it is at this juncture. I’ve been to Palestine. It was bad—while I do not believe a genocide is occurring, it is absolutely an apartheid situation, and something has to change. 


My Jewish American friends are rocked.  They feel very betrayed.  I am doing what I can to validate their experiences by sharing  my observations of the blatant antisemitism that I’m seeing—because it IS that. It is as if their current experience “doesn’t count” because they are “white.” They are specifically crushed that many groups of marginalized people they have fought for are not fighting for them in turn.  I truly think if people had the historical understanding of how recent The Holocaust was, how dangerously close we were to eradicating an entire group of people off the planet,, and how truly and deeply Hamas wants to complete that mission, things would be a little different.  

My Muslim American friends are doing okay (none have direct links to Palestine), and are invigorated by the support and attention the humanitarian crisis in Palestine is receiving.
I haven’t voiced where I stand on this issue to them— I am still finding words, and I’m afraid of losing relationships over this. I am hoping to engage in meaningful, in person discourse, as opposed to sharing a post online. 

This all could have played out so differently if people approached the situation with some semblance of nuance and historical context. I’m really dismayed and disheartened right now. I’ve deleted all social media platforms aside from Reddit, because the echo chambers are so rabid. It’s been quite heartbreaking, and I hope some sort of balance returns.

Leftists think it’s inherently noble to defend the one being taken advantage of. For many, they see a poor population with darker skin vs a rich nation with a robust military and turn it into the social Justice issues we have in America. I think for many Israel is viewed as overpowered invaders trying to take away the lives of those can only defend themselves with rocks and stones. It’s cartoonish, but many of us have grown so much intellectually with age through lessons learned after college.

They view forced expulsions and demolitions as ‘ethnic cleansing’ and generally don’t buy into Israeli victimhood. They argue that creating chaos and destabilisation is a fundamental tool in maintaining control… and in all fairness, there are historical precedents to support this - when the British were in Ireland, they used to shoot civilians in Belfast and Derry for no reason while wearing civilian clothes. This created new problems, and the British stayed there as a stabilising force. That was also the tactic of the British and French in the Middle East at the height of the empires (destabilise, divide, and rule) and that’s the tactic they claim Israel uses in Gaza and the West Bank.

8943,">I’m not taking either side. But I’m intrigued as to why there is a defined left and right allegiance to each side.

I'm still struggling to understand why showing concerns for innocent human lives on both sides suddenly translates into taking the side of Palestine over Israel. But lately I keep seeing all these posts titled ""Why is the left Pro-Palestine?"" or ""Why does the left hate Israel "" which seems like a misrepresentation of how people feel. All it does is turn yet another issue into a left/right partisan war. It also fuels an onslaught of responses from anti-leftists who love to reduce everything to race by claiming that the left is racist towards white people, and think white=bad, brown= good. 

Last I checked, Biden was left-leaning and has stated that the USA backs Israel.  Most of the left-leaning news stations in the USA focus a lot more on the tragedy of what happened in Israel and they do a better job of humanizing the experience of the people in Israel. We see very few one-on-one interviews with the families of the Palestinian victims. Instead, we mainly see clips of Palestinians angrily protesting around world. So these left vs right generalizations are baffling. I wouldn't be surprised if they were started by a bot and have now taken on a life of their own. 

However, if people are determined to view things through a left vs right partisan lens, a more fitting question would be: ""Why is the right so Anti-Palestinian?"" Not anti-Hamas (I personally don't know anyone who is not anti-Hamas), but specifically Anti-Palestinian? If we (as outsiders) can all have compassion for the innocent people of Israel who were hurt by recent tragic events, why can the right not do the same for the innocent Palestinians living under terrible conditions in Gaza. If you phrase the question that way, I wonder how many of the same anti-leftists would default to racism as their answer.",2023-10-21 07:01:27

8966,"I believe there are two key aspects to this perspective. The first aspect is the tendency to oversimplify international conflicts, particularly in an American context, by framing them as a literal black-or-white issue. This oversimplification often portrays one side as the oppressor and the other as the oppressed, regardless of the intricate complexities underlying the situation. For example, the Israel-Palestine conflict is much more multifaceted than this simplistic portrayal suggests. However, leftists, in their quest to align with the perceived ""right side"" and to adopt a clear cause for their identity, tend to reduce such conflicts to a more digestible narrative. This approach ignores the fact that the values held by a typical American leftist don't align with the average Gazan, and certainly not with Hamas. Even though nonbinary, gay, atheist feminists in interracial relationships would surely find better treatment in Israel than in Gaza -- and should the terrorists succeed with their hopeful ""river to the sea"" genocide of Israel, we would have yet another right-wing theocracy in the middle east -- their emphasis often falls on supporting Gazans due to the disproportionate impact of rocket attacks on the ""people of color"" of this situation.

The second aspect is their hatred of the United States and American democracy. Most leftists hate America and its ""western"", democratic principles. Israel, as the most democratic nation in the Middle East and a strong American ally, is simply a convenient vessel for this hatred. The IDF is essentially an unofficial branch of the U.S. military in the Middle East. Since leftists are not supportive of American democracy's success, they feel the need to take a stand against it, often leading to a hatred of Israel.",2023-10-20 21:04:01

They hate those white people, happy for their support on this issue, but damn Europe has screwed themselves for good with demographics, unless all of these far right parties that are winning more and more support can get millions of them deported . This is the main issue in every European country and the far right parties in power, world is going to see some major ethnic cleansing of the Arabs back to their own countries. 

After the past two weeks, white people seeing all of this support for terrorism in the US, there are going to be some mass deportations here too when Republicans easily win presidency next year. Jews are certainly going to flee the Democrat party and give tons of support to Republicans who are providing full throated support of Israel and Jews, even though they don't like leftist Jews.

8968,"I think its mostly because in recent times emotional arguments are the only thing the left can really win elections on now so activists have fostered this culture of going after the simple narratives and supporting slogans essentially as opposed to policy. It's the classic marxist approach of highlighting oppressor vs oppressed situations, counting on being able to court the ""oppressed"" vote. That's why they mostly choose slogans you can't really argue against - ""black lives matter"" works because who can really argue against it - though the less politically aware types might come out with a ""defund the police"" type of argument that just doesn't work at all because its very easy to challenge.

The situation in Gaza now has been framed by the left as another oppressor vs oppressed narrative. It will work on many on the left, particularly on the hard left and the casual observers who pick it up as the latest thing (the kind of people who put a black box on Instagram during BLM protests). ""Free Palestine"" is one of those arguments its impossible to argue against - because what's the opposite of free. Certainly not something most would want to vocally express a desire for.

I think it would be more accurate to say that leftists are more politically neutral when it comes to the Israel Palestine conflict.

The reasons for this are slightly complex. For one, Benjamin Netanyahu has been prime minister since 2009, and since he's a nationalist right winger, it's no surprise that the left might oppose him. Leftists take issue with the settlers, the generally aggressive policy with the two Palestinian governments, the handling of the Arab population within Israel proper, and right wing domestic policy, generally. It's pretty clear that Bibi has not taken the best course over the past 14 years to promote peace and prevent attacks like this.

Secondly, the idea of anti-colonialism (including ""neocolonialism"") is powerful among some segments of today's left. A lot of people feel the U.S. has the habit of interfering in wars and governments all the world, using justifications like ""freedom"" and ""peace"", when the real reasons is cynical political and economic calculus. Iran and Chile are notable examples from the 20th century. When viewed through this lens, some people believe that Israel is part of the tradition of Western colonialism in the Middle East. In this view, the UN creating Israel was part of that tradition, and that has shaped the conflict since. A lot of leftists are also strongly anti-war, and see the rhetoric by the Israel government as an attempt to justify an expansive war that will lead to deaths of far more than the terrorists in Hamas.

But it's worth noting that the mainstream Democratic party in the U.S. strongly supports Israel, even if it's not ravenously eager for a large war to start in the Middle East.

In the case of Hamas, their ideology can be at least understood. Ultimately what Hamas are fighting for is a perceived injustice at Israel having taken most of the land and forcing many Palestinians to live in terrible conditions in Gaza, or by taking more and more land via settlements in the West Bank.  They also believe that the Palestinian authority is far too soft and are not standing up for Palestinian rights. 

Why they and Palestine get sympathy is a) Out of the two it is Palestine who is very much subdued overall and b) whenever there are causalities, it’s always more Palestinians that die. So from a purely human perspective, it’s s lot easier to sympathise with Palestine as it’s their rights and their lives that are more assaulted.

Where it then gets very complicated is that on the surface level Israel look like they are very aggressive, but I feel like what they will argue is that they are left with no choice when Hamas AND neighbouring Arab countries want to see them go away. Bear in mind that in 1948 it was more or less a 50/50 split that was proposed and even then a war was initiated because the Arab world disagreed with the israel project. 

Even if Israel were to offer that same deal today, which relative to how Palestinians are living today is a significant upgrade, the question to everyone on the left would be - would that be fair?

They sound just like Hamas just replace the religion. Which is why this is so important. 

The genetic profile of Palestinians has, for the first time, been studied by using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variability and haplotypes. The comparison with other Mediterranean populations by using neighbor-joining dendrograms and correspondence analyses reveal that Palestinians are genetically very close to Jews and other Middle East populations, including Turks (Anatolians), Lebanese, Egyptians, Armenians, and Iranians. Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, BUT NOT IN GENETIC differences.”

9028,"Lots of answers here, but I don't think they get the core matter. Here's my take.

Without taking any stance, historical facts, show that the state of Israel was created initially as a racial/religious ideological state to be located there, a plan has been set in motion by the powers that be (bankers, powerful industrialists etc) at the turn of the century, the original ""Zionists"". After WWI, the Ottoman Empire left a vacuum in the region, and land was quickly used ad merchandise by UK and France, regardless of the interest of the local population (Arabs, by far). Israel continued to take shape. By WW2, stuff really hit the fan and, the USA entered the scene and, once more, the powers that be (this time, the winners of the war, through the UN) re-drew the plans again. There were a lot of hidden agendas, cold war issues, American meddling, etc. 

Sorry for the rough history lesson, but there's a point: at each step and milestone of the formation of the state of Israel, there were powers acting and schemes set in motion which are things typical for the left-wing not to like: lack of democratic process, colonialism, ""behind closed doors"" decision making, capitalistic interests, even the very notion of ""nationality-based"" States, but also the military-industrial complex, cold war dynamics, anti-militarism, anti-NATO, pro-Communism, and more recently the love for minorities and dislike of any type of islamophobia. 

And, to this list, I must add no small dose of antisemitism.

And a general liking of whoever is ""the underdog"".


Conversely, the right-wing historically doesn't have nearly as many ideological issues with the above mentioned list of ""objections"" held by the left-wing.


By this I don't mean the left-wing is right (no pun intended), or that I agree with these views. But it is what I have encountered most when interacting with left-wing pro-Palestine.

Simply put, in many respects, Palestine-Israel is yet another conflict caused by American meddling and post-colonial power plays.",2023-10-20 20:06:02

I remember not long ago Azov who are openly neo Nazis and bombed civilians for 8 years killing thousands are considered heroes by USA and not terrorists. Whereas Hamas is doing the same by trying to liberate lands yet they’re terrorists

 Imagine you live in You come into someone’s house because you were homeless and they host you. You then kick out it’s residents despite the fact that they were living in there for generations, claim it as your own and make those people who were living there homeless. They are then forced to live in a corner of the neighborhood in crowded and poor conditions. You also shoot at them, bomb them, send phosphorus bombs on them that burn flesh to the bone, deprive them of food, water and electricity from time to time to teach them a lesson. You also don’t let them vote as you consider them second class and not true citizens. Then after you took 90% of what’s not yours you have the courage to evict the people again under threat of bombs, knowing full well that badly injured in hospitals and babies on ventilators can’t evacuate. Then you convince the whole world that you have the right to come into someone’s house and steal it, all based on the fact that a few hundred of years BC in prehistoric times people of your faith used to live there. Then, after you killed thousands of inhabitants and stole more houses, they plan a revenge attack to right the decades long injustice, so you cry victim and call them “terrorists”. So let me ask you how does siding with a bully and a thief make you right ? Do you really think that by bombing them some more and killing more children you will “free” them and make them less angry and rebellious? So by the same logic Amerindians have the claim to Canada and US, especially considering that they have recently had a civilization there. So they should bomb Americans until they leave and if they resist they’re “terrorists”.

Obviously leftists will side with the genocided, as empathy is a core leftist value no matter what leftist trend is it exactly.

Secondly - systemic analysis
Israel is a project of settler colonialism, it does in it's entirety focus on displacing and eliminating the native population in order to achieve a Lebensraum for the chosen nationality. If we take a systemic approach to Israel, which is what drives many socialists and especially marxists, then we will see that there is a dialectic of the oppressors and the oppressed, but those are not only slap words, as proven in the former part of this point.

They think enemy nations that occupy foregin areas are a free-picking in everything about them :  including civilians  .. even anti-war ones .

They just don't understand even if said civilian was a vile person , armed , did heinous things towards ""the other"" people ,   a military reservist , or even a war criminal or former soilder who made atrocities   :  killing him in the name of a national  cause ,  says something entirely else about it than killing active combatants on service .

This  mentality  is what made them pay the dear price  that most people view Palestinian political activates are not towards self-determination statehood rather than ad-hominems aganist Israeli-Jews solely because they are Israelis , and in some extreme cases : just because of thier Jewish ethnicity  .

There is a thin line in being a militant who is  a guerilla freedom-fighter , and scum bags like ISIS .. Many Palestinians forget thier original problem that is indeed of legitmate greviances (self-determination , and statehood , and the right to live as a nation in its homeland ) with the Israeli-state all-together  and just focus on spiting Israelis just for the sake of vengeance and despise  .  Those supporting such  militants are of that type .

..Again : It's no secret Hamas wants such bloodbaths : it's already reflected in thier charter and what they have been doing  since 2006 ... It's just quite shocking to see they actually kept thier word in trying to recreate  the 7th century , even if it involves so much blood  , and just for the sake of doing it .

&#x200B;

As for the schoolyard comparison :  the Israeli-state did a hell of lot more than just ""bullying"" Palestinians .  It's more like ruining the foundations of thier  lives :   taking Homes , livelihood , families , and  most important of all : the right to exist as nation  , with a sovereign state in its own homeland .  That dosen't excuse bloodthirsty vendetta  or grant the right to do the same to others : but it explains the basis of how at least most Palestinians think .

Just want to say : I hope everybody stays safe , and nobody else gets hurt .. those bastards (No offense to those who cheer-on Hamas , despite condoning or consenting to bloodshed ) probably just want a hostage exchange  , similar to what Black September tried  doing in 1972 Munich ...just hope this time it ends quickly  , and Hamas gets what they want and leave .

This isn't a game of choosing sides like in a sporting event. It's a harrowing humanitarian crisis with real lives hanging in the balance.

Your blind admiration for the Israeli army's 'restraint' is misplaced, to say the least. It's akin to praising a bully for not stealing lunch money on one particular day while overlooking the fact that he's been terrorizing the playground for years. Over 4,000 children killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, and you're here applauding the 'restraint' of the aggressors? The irony is both tragic and astounding.

You throw around terms like 'Islamic jihad crap' with a casual disdain that reeks of ignorance. This isn't about jihadist ideologies; it's about a desperate struggle for freedom, justice, and basic human rights. The Palestinians' plea is for the restoration of their dignity, not an endorsement of extremist ideologies.

Your attempt to justify the unjustifiable under the guise of combating 'illegal Islamic immigration' is both baseless and irrelevant to the conversation at hand. It's a desperate grasp at straws to justify a stance that's as hollow as it is harmful.

You've managed to oversimplify a deeply entrenched crisis into a one-dimensional, misguided narrative that does nothing but broadcast a startling lack of understanding.

The cultural ideas of the United States, and Europe and you participate in, is the culture that has lead to a bad effect on how you see the world. Islamophobia, Xenophobia and Discrimination are not good things to perpetuate. It's nothing more than a reflection of the culture around you, and how you have build the world from your experience. 

Cultural ideals within the society at large in the United states and it's harder shift right since the 1980s during the reagan administration and the war on drugs, and because of the integration of Nazi elites into an already culturally right wing society during operation paperclip. During (1945-1959). That You and by extension The Population of the united states have no idea of the Aparthied state that Palestinians have lived in since the start of the entire ordeal in the 1950s, after the colonial ideas of the time period enabled Zionists to move into the land, and create Israel who has taken people in from across the world to build social cohesion with the ""international community"" (nato). That has exploited Ethiopian Jews by pulling them from their politically unstable regions to help the zionist idea of ""A place for the people of Jewish faith to call a home"" that has led  to culturally and directly commit genocide against Palestinians for 80 years, and that the west has been complicit in the idea because European Culture is the same white culture that perpetuated the death of natives in the United States, Slavery, Segregation, The Nazis in world War 2, The Armenian Genocide, and I'll even go father and say the reason you think it's okay is the perpetuation of Islamophobic tendencies that have existed since 9/11 in The United States Society as a whole because it's been shown to you non stop and perpetuated by the discriminatory white society that has existed for years. Before you got to the United states you were probably a different person than you are now, and that because you have assimilated into a western liberal bias that virtue signals based on identity to distract and sell that culture to you have now actively perpetuated the genocide of other people specifically targeted minorities who have lived in the area for years even before you existed. 

Can I also guess you came to the US around 2008? Maybe? Start of the Greek financial crisis? Or are you a Greek orthodox Christian? Or was it you wanted to persue a free life? Because I'm gonna be honest with you. The American Idea of ""The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave"" is nothing more than a marketing ploy now. Appropriated by the Capitalist elite who sell your culture to you. The cultural idea of Christianity in Europe. By white society Who use that culture to discriminate against the lesser and virtue signal to other people that they are good and honest people. Who use that culture to sell you Islamophobia indirectly by using religion to bond to you and make you feel safe and let your guard down. 

Don't fall for the wolf who is dressed as a sheep; my friend. 
Please be safe. These people will kill you for being Greek too. Just like the zionists are killing Palestinians for living space. Like the Americans killed the natives for manifest destiny and forced them to walk on death marches,like the Nazis killed the jews the poles the gays, the Greeks, the communists, the Czechs, and eventually anyone who spoke out. Why disinformation is spread through society to perpetuate the narrative of the Zionists. Why disinformation was spread through Germany to perpetuate Nazi Ideology. Why the news focuses on school shooting to promote fear in society for social control. The reason the united states invests so much in its military budget. To make sure the world stage is just as fearful of them as everyone was of the Nazis. Why the school shootings are happening because the kids mental health is so terrible because the parents have intergenerational truama, are too poor to have the necessities needed to get mental health treated. Who's kids can't learn because they are too hungry: because food is privatized and not a human right. Because the idea of this white culture that exists is to make an giant ethnostate, worldwide. By making sure the culture sold to them is inconsistent to distract everyone while they do terrible things, and no one can act and everyone remains under the mystery and devolves into this discussions like this.

He would be happy to have the protestors kill everyone on that plane if it distracts the world from the bigger fight for even one second.

Freedom of speech must be protected at all costs. It's the most fundamental right that we have in the developed world. It must never be sacrificed. Even in the US, where so many of us are obsessed with violence, free speech is the first thing listed in our bill of rights, not freedom to own guns. That's because our founders knew that without the freedom to speak our minds, including to protest, we would devolve into a land and oppression and violence. 

We can't afford to surrender our freedoms. Doing so will make us not only less free but less safe. This is a valuable lesson we can learn from those countries who oppress their own people, Russia being one of them. This doesn't mean that we have to allow violence. What happened shouldn't have and wouldn't have happened in the West. 

To quote one of my nation's founders and someone well regarded across the West, Benjamin Franklin:

""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""

If we give up our most fundamental liberty, the freedom of self expression, we condemn ourselves to the same type of oppression experienced by the Russian people. We simply can't do it.

It is illiberal, undemocratic, unethical, and ultimately injurious to discourse to limit the speech of any person for any reason, as far as the government is concerned. This doesn't immunize people from the consequences of their speech in the public sphere, only as far as their civil rights may allow. Until an assembly becomes a riot, it shall not be abridged. Let these people announce their beliefs to the world. And let all the consequences thereof apply. Yeah, freedom. 

The issue is the line that can be crossed.  That is the physical violence, harm, property destruction, and the speech which encouraged it. But only after the line is crossed. Actus reus and mens rea, i.e. crimes require thought and deed. The allowance is lliteral Nazis having parades in the public spaces. Nothing more un-American than the NSDAP.

What kind of world are you living in? Rallies and protests are important parts of any democratic nation and banning any kind of rally as long as it is peaceful, is violating the fundamental rights of the people living there. And seriously, are you saying that pro-Palestinian rallies are the cause of anti-semitism? And what about those times when police in France were cracking down upon peaceful protesters who were just protesting for a ceasefire and for the liberation of Palestine from Israeli occupation (which ofc you might deny but God help you). My friend studying in America told me that Muslim students in college and public workplaces are getting beaten up by mobs of pro-Israelis and Zionists. And this is for the other side too, i know Jewish people have started changing their names on Ubers, avoiding visiting synagogues. So don't come up here bashing one side and blindly supporting the other.

I have no dog in this fight but after doing alot of research on this subject Palestinians were treated worse than slaves and continually to this day had their homes taken away.  The US can only protect Israels genocide for so long and Oct 7 was Israels wake up call.  To answer your question why this happened in Dagestan, well History repeats itself and I do not think many Isreals will be welcome to many places for a very very long time. You can lobby the US govt, you can doctrine the histry books but you cannot erase what was is on going on the internet.  Israel had some respect for a while but that is all gone, this has erased everything for you guys.  Look around at the anti semitism, this was not around 1 month ago!

These series of events are important because it motivated many Jews from these countries to settle in Israel and further strengthened Zionism, which just means ""Jewish nationalism"", nothing especially nefarious.

Yet another event they completely glossed over were the expulsion of Jews from predominantly Muslim countries, in which many Jews who had been settled in most of the Muslim world for centuries were kicked out, deported, or coerced into leaving to Israel in reaction to the end of the first Israeli War. Most of these Jews tended to be the least Zionistic, yet they were kicked out anyway, and this is where most of Israel's population is descended from.

It's a strawman they told you. It's easier to ""feel more"" pro-Palestine when you think the enemy is... (((rich white bankers and moguls from lower-side Manhattan))) who came in and kicked out innocent poor brown people from their indigenous land than descendants of refugees kicked out of their own ancestral homes.

What's really concerning is ironically, the enemy they so claim to be against, white supremacists, benefit greatly from these narratives because the counter-narratives to white supremacist history are becoming just as ridiculous.

9368,"This is the mental gymnastics they do to hate on Jews. They want to emphasise that they do not belong, even though their own religion says so.

Here, check from an ex muslim what islam teaches and maybe you'll get a clue:

Sahih al-Bukhari 2926
Narrated Abu Huraira:
Allah's Messenger (e) said, ""The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say.
""O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.""

Muslims are thought to hate Jews and kill them wherever they find them. Since young , Jews are used as a derogatory way, to fortify stereotypes. they say anything cut throat pricing as “Harga Yahudi “ or “Kejam mcm zionis” which means cruel as zionis. It’s so common, and used in normal everyday conversations and with kids, as a means to dehumanise Jews and hate them. 

Hence, the hatred for Jews is as essential in Islam as the love for Prophet Muhammad. It’s sunnah to hate Jews.  

Of course, nowadays, in 2023 it’s bit difficult to be openly racist and call the genocide of an entire group of people just because Islam wills it. So muslims, will internalise this hatred, and then use any form of justification to hate on Israel and Jews. Gaslight and call for so called peace when it fact it’s just pure hatred as mandated by the Quran and Islam.

Well in 1881, Jews were about 20k (5 percent) of the population of what would become modern day Israel and the occupied territories.  

Between 1882 and 1918, 62.5k Jews immigrated to that land; of which the vast majority (47.5k) were from the Russian Empire (including Eastern Europe, where most Russian Jews -like my own family!- was from).

Then between 1919 and the founding of Israel in 1948, 482.8k more Jews immigrated to the land.  Of which, 377.5k were from Europe.

So, in short: from 1882 until Israel was founded…
Around 545,000 Jews immigrated to that land (from a starting population of 20k).  And of those new arrivals, around 425,000 of them (78 percent) were from what is generally defined as Europe.

1)Pakistan has been proving a safe place for the terrorists who are responsible for many attacks in India. My Uncle has lost his close friend in the 2008 Bomb blasts. India has warned the world many times, but they never paid attention. This is similar with Palestine where Hamas is operating.
2) Israel has been providing the aid to Palestine, in a similar manner, India has provided aid to Pakistan many times such as during natural disasters. A major part of the water that Pakistan receives comes from the river which flows through India first and we have a treaty signed for the same.
3) Pakistan teaches it's children wrong History and puts hatred in their children. Whenever something bad happens, they celebrate it. Of course not all but most.
4) The ideology of Jihad is same. After the partition of India, Pakistan has been treating their minorities very badly. They force them to convert. The population of Hindus have fall greatly. Recently, 100 Pakistani Hindus we're given Indian citizenship and they informed how they were I'll treated.
5) They claim Kashmir as theirs which is a holy place for Hindus as Lord Shiva is said to hold importance for Mount Kailash. The name of Kashmir is itself derived from the Sage Kashyapa and if Pakistan itself did not existed before partition, how can they claim it?
6) They spread a lot of false lies on Sanatana Dharma. For example, they say Sita Maa was 6 when she was married but in the texts it clearly mentions she was above 18, the original texts. This is one such thing they do, so that they can spread hate on us. 
That is the reason why you see many Hindus supporting Israel because we both are suffering from the same Jihad Ideology.
Mughals had killed more than 80 million Hindus, destroyed more than 40000 Hindu temples and made our women their slaves. Just few years back, Radical Muslims had killed their Hindu neighbours.

Let me be clear, I strongly believe the establishment of Israel in 1948 was illegitimate, but 75 years have now passed, so unfortunately there is no unringing that bell.

Firstly, Israel will never agree to dissolve itself.

Secondly, the West would never allow for Israel to be forcefully dissolved.

Thirdly, as you alluded to, there are generations of Israeli who were born and raised in that land. This has complicated things infinitely.

The issue is that the agreement of a two state solution itself is still an incredibly complex issue.

There are two big sticking points:
- sovreignty of East Jerusalem
- the right to return for Palestinians (an internationally recognised human right).

I believe that the East Jerusalem issue can be resolved, but the right to return issue has no straightforward answer.",2023-11-19 20:03:13

""When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.""

 It is sad to see how in the 22nd century, with all the technology we have, many are incapable of creating their own ideas based on facts and truths, not only on beliefs or ideologies that have no scientific or rational merit. ""From the river to the sea"", just because it rhymes does not mean that it is a beautiful message and even less of peace, it means in the best of cases the departure of human beings from a region and in the worst of cases their extermination, something that is written and daily lived by religious extremists and if not applauded at least tolerated by their followers. How is it possible that we are not united in at least seeing that the kidnapped people are released? For the love of God they have children. There will be people who will say ""they are also killing children"", and honestly I don't know what to say to that because it would be a long conversation, just open your eyes and don't compare a military operation with a terrorist act, don't tell me is the same  when a group of young people is singing and dancing and suddenly people arrive with weapons and they are killed, violated and kidnaped  with a war where everyone knows that they will eventually be affected and at least you can say goodbye to your loved ones, the lack of humanity and empathy is heartbreaking.",2023-11-19 11:53:42

While Iran is backing Hamas, that only includes sending them weapons and sharing intelligence; they're not sending Iranian troops.  So there has been a general acceptance of Israel's right to exist by the world's national governments, de facto if not official.  


Of course, you'll get a very different idea from the protests and popular rhetoric.  Whether that translates into national policy is the question.  Here in the US, Biden is taking a hit among young people, but it's hard to believe that they will vote for Trump, or allow Trump to win by voting third party when they agree with the Democrats on every other issue and the Republicans are even more pro-Israel.  I'm not sure how Muslims will vote next year; there was already a move toward the Republicans over their disagreement with the Democrats' LGBTQ policy.

I think your interpretation of some of the slogans and talking points is incorrect. Many of us (tbh I think it’s the vast majority of us) who say “from the river to the sea” or say “Israel shouldn’t exist” don’t mean every Jew or every Israeli must leave. We mean it needs to become a single state with equal rights for all. Yes, that means Israel as it currently exists is “destroyed”, in the same way as Apartheid South Africa was “destroyed”. It doesn’t mean every Israeli Jew must leave, but it does mean you can’t impose it being a Jewish state with Apartheid laws and a brutal occupation of the natives.

Decolonisation doesn’t mean genocide. There’s enough room in the land for both Jews and Palestinians to live. But it does mean that it can’t stay a discriminatory ethno-state.

I live in South Africa. People were saying there would be a genocide of the white people when apartheid ended. There wasn’t. There won’t be a genocide of Jews if they come to the table and diplomatically agree for everyone to be treated equally. Will there be a high chance of violence? Yes, but violence is happening right now. There’s much more chance of a lasting peace if you actually give the Palestinians dignity, the chance to have a normal life and the chance to return to their homes and their families’ homes. Yes, life will probably become worse for many Israelis who have taken advantage of unequal treatment for decades. But it was the same in South Africa. And we made it work.",2023-11-20 03:11:17

9460,"The way I see it, Israel has several large negative trends going against it.

First of all, history tells us that unless you entirely vanquish a nation they will come back. You guys aren’t gonna be able to kill 400 million Arabs, let alone the millions of Palestinians in your midst. No colonial power has held onto another nation forever unless they vanquished them completely. It’s never happened. The USA for example, completely annihilated the natives. So did Australia. But Algeria kicked out the French. Libya kicked out the Italians. The Belgians had to leave the Congo. So on and so forth. Israelis are in denial that they are a colony founded by European Jews, with the aid of the Europeans who didn’t want to pay the reparations for the holocaust so they figured they could foist it on the Arabs. I’m not making a moral argument here; it’s simply a matter of truth whether you agree or not- the origin of the Israeli state is mostly European Jewish transplants. Not true natives in a practical sense.

Secondly, I don’t believe they can exist independently without US backing. Palestinians have the ability and will to fight and endure catastrophic losses both financial and physical. This war is already projected to cost 50 billion dollars. What happens if that aid evaporates? The public approval of Israel as an ally amongst the millennial and gen z in the USA is no longer the majority. The Zionist monopoly on the media has been broken by TikTok. And the overly aggressive criticism of any voices of American dissent for the status quo had highlighted the outsized influence of Zionists in our country. People are questioning America’s role in the conflict and whether it’s constructive over here. That is a sea of change from even just 10 years ago. 

Moreover, Israel benefitted from a point in history where the surrounding Arab states are weak and corrupt. For now they continue to be so, but we already see that Israel failed to anticipate that Iran would swoop in from the east and essentially completely encircle Israel. Israel liked having weak neighbors but now they should have second thoughts. Iran now realistically controls Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. They also are at the cusp of being a nuclear power. 

Thirdly, Israel’s quality of leaders and ‘true believers’ had gone down. Gone are the shimon Perez or yitzak rahbins or Ben Gurions. Netenyahu is a self serving corrupt hack and what’s worse is he has a solid base of support. In other words, the quality leadership that carried the day in Israel is no longer present and are making mistakes at a very crucial point in your history. The smart Israelis know this. A political solution to the Palestinian question would have been a way safer bet for Israel’s future. Instead, Israel has chosen the might makes right approach, which cuts both ways. 

Israelis believe that they got the land through conquest and should get to keep it- and that the world should forget about it and that the Arabs should accept this reality and too bad so sad. But what Happens when the balance of power shifts, as it always does in history. Once the Arabs CAN kick you out, they WILL, and won’t think twice about it. Because that is the fate of every foreign colony. You can call them terrorists all you want, but it doesn’t change this reality. You think the French left Algeria cause they asked politely ? No, they bombed the shit out of them, and it was a bloody struggle. But a colonial power only is willing to sacrifice so much.

Although the ministry of health in Gaza is considered to be credible in they're number reportings, they don't distinguish between civilians and militants in their publications.

I haven't found any source about the age which Palestinians can join Hamas, but since child is anyone below 18, it's enough that Hamas would recruit 16 year olds to explain the children numbers.

Lastly, let's agree on some things and then do some math together. Let's agree that Israel has a much stronger military power, and that Hamas killed people indiscriminately in 7/10.
 If Israel killed ~9,000 people in 30 day, that ends up being about 300 people a day.
Compare to Hamas's 1,500 in a day, that means Israel kills 5 times slower than Hamas.

Are you seriously trying to say that Israel, with it's much stronger military force, is trying to commit genocide and kill indiscriminately all Palestinians, but it takes then 5 times as much time as Hamas to to kill? Make it make sense.",2023-11-06 16:35:17

The six stages of genocide:

1.) Give the people 3 weeks to evacuate and send them maps of escape routes.

2.) Drop thousands of leaflets, send thousands of SMS, and make calls to warn the population before an area is bombed.

3.) Focus on military targets that are intentionally placed near civilian areas to maximize casualties.

4.) Allow humanitarian aid to enter the area you’re attacking.

5.) Kill 9000+ people in a state with a population of over 2 millions despite having one of the most advanced militaries in the world.

6.) Allow the population to continue accessing the internet despite the fact that it is advantageous for your enemy.

9548,"Let's see what an actual expert on genocides says on this matter:

# Raz Segal

*Associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University and the endowed professor in the study of modern genocide.*

The following is an excerpt from an interview with this expert:

>I think that, indeed, what we’re seeing now in Gaza is a case of genocide. We have to understand that the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide from 1948 requires that we see special intent for genocide to happen. And to quote the convention, intent to destroy a group is defined as racial, ethnic, religious or national as such that is collectively, not just individuals. And this intent, as we just heard, is on full display by Israeli politicians and army officers since 7th of October. We heard Israel’s president. It’s well-known what the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on 9th of October declaring a complete siege on Gaza, cutting off water, food, fuel, stating that “We’re fighting human animals,” and we will react “accordingly.” He also said that “We will eliminate everything.” We know that Israeli army spokesperson Daniel Hagari, for example, acknowledged wanton destruction and said explicitly, “The emphasis on damage and not on accuracy.” So we’re seeing the special intent on full display. And really, I have to say, if this is not special intent to commit genocide, I really don’t know what is.  
>  
>So, when we look at the actions taken, the dropping of thousands and thousands of bombs in a couple of days, including phosphorus bombs, as we heard, on one of the most densely populated areas around the world, together with these proclamations of intent, this indeed constitutes genocidal killing, which is the first act, according to the convention, of genocide. And Israel, I must say, is also perpetrating act number two and three — that is, causing serious bodily or mental harm, and creating condition designed to bring about the destruction of the group by cutting off water, food, supply of energy, bombing hospitals, ordering the fast evictions of hospitals, which the World Health Organization has declared to be, quote, “a death sentence.” So, we’re seeing the combination of genocidal acts with special intent. This is indeed a textbook case of genocide.

# TL;DR

* Prof Segal is Israeli, so you can't accuse him of bias against Israel
* He is literally a professor in the study of modern genocide, so you can't claim he doesn't understand genocide
* A person with THESE credentials says in unambiguous terms that:
   * ""I think that, indeed, what we’re seeing now in Gaza is a case of genocide""
   * ""really, I have to say, if this is not special intent to commit genocide, I really don’t know what is""
   * ""So, we’re seeing the combination of genocidal acts with special intent. This is indeed a textbook case of genocide.""

# Case Closed

Honestly, when Prof Segal so clearly defines his stance, I really don't care if you think the genocide claim is ""absurd"".

It's also genocide to drop epic tonnages of ordinance onto a strip of land with 21k people per Sq mile, including destroying over 50% of all residential structures.  It's also a genocide when you tell the people to move south then bomb the people moving south, then bomb the south, then bomb the Egyptian crossing after telling people to go there.

Israel knows Hamas is underground and their civilian hostages are safe there.  They are purposefully bombing civilian infrastructure in an attempt to make Gaza unliveable, so the people there will either die or accept relocation.  Civilian lives are completely expendable.  There's 4,800 children dead in order to supposedly kill a few dozen Hamas operatives.  Tens of thousands of people bombed with ordinance, hit with missiles, and blasted with white phosphorous.  It's beyond a genocide, It's definitionally also a holocaust.

You literally have to have sociopathic pathological disconnects to be okay with the numbers of civilian casualties, all to get a handful of freedom Fighters, especially if you ever bothered to look at video and footage of the people who's lives are being taken, like  Zeina here..

Your argument that the death toll numbers are not to be trusted is not substantiated. Besides the Gaza health ministry, third parties like the Associated Press and the UN have already said while tracking death tolls is tricky during an ongoing onslaught, the numbers coming from the ministry closely resembles theirs.

Your argument that the IDF is humane because it gave people warning to move is invalid, since forcible transfer is a war crime, and in many instances, the IDF has struck ambulances, refugee camps and convoys that were not in the areas those people were illegally forced to move from.

9570,"This post is blatant Hasbara propaganda but at the slim chance that you’re not being paid to subvert reality I’ll add some nuance. 

Let's talk about the silent crisis that seldom seizes the headlines, yet it cuts to the core of human existence — water. Gaza's water is undrinkable, with 96% of its coastal aquifer contaminated by sewage and salt, a bitter testament to a blockade and infrastructural constraints that deny Gazans agency over their most vital resource​. 

Israel's recent decision to cut off water supplies intensifies this agony, purportedly in response to hostilities but resulting in dire humanitarian repercussions​. Palestinians face draconian limits on improving their water systems, their wells demolished, their reservoirs razed, languishing under what has been branded 'water apartheid'​. The disparity is stark: Israeli settlers reportedly consume up to six times more water than Palestinians, who must often rely on expensive or unreliable sources​. 

The systematic deprivation of water, and thereby health and life, can't be seen as anything other than a methodical undermining of a people's right to exist. 

To frame this crisis as anything less than a deliberate strategy to marginalize and deplete a population would be to overlook the evidence of a severe humanitarian catastrophe with potential genocidal implications. The term 'genocide' carries with it the weight of intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. While the international community grapples with the legal semantics, the undeniable reality is that denying Gazans access to clean water systematically deteriorates their quality of life, potentially leading to a demographic decline. This crisis, then, is not just a violation of human rights; it is an affront to humanity itself.",2023-11-07 11:58:48

What is acceptable numbers of civilian lives to combatants? Isreali government are uncountable at this point per point 1 2 3. Combatant lives are however acceptable losses. Civilian infrastructure isn't just hamas infrastructure because they can use force to let civilians that would stand up to them use it. The complete lack of Isreal to accept that they could risk military personnel lives that agree to be combatants instead of killing dozens and hundreds civilians because they might maybe, possibly, get a combat target is not acceptable. Isreal has every right to defend itself, but,  For one of the most powerful militaries in the world who has the enemy contained within walls and cornered but decide to bomb refugee camps and necessary civilian infrastructure is cowardice to the highest degree.

9584,"The genocide claim isn’t absurd if you know what genocide is.

“genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Nowhere in the definition of the crime of genocide is there a numerical qualifier. When smaller groups are the victims of genocide, or when the main means of genocide is other than killing, often public debates are framed around the comparably smaller numbers of deaths. More often than not, those who make the numerical argument, base it on the assumption that “not enough” members of a targeted group have been killed. In itself a rather genocidal argument.

9590,"The definition of genocide is the killing of large number of people from a nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that group, so I guess it just depends on what you believe Israel’s end goal is here. And to those who say their end goal is ending Hamas and that only, i would advise you to look again at the death toll over the past 75 yrs (not even considering the death toll in the past weeks, which has been unprecedented):

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.statista.com/chart/amp/16516/israeli-palestinian-casualties-by-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank/

As well as considering the fact that they’ve shut off water, electricity, and prevented imports of food, building materials, medicine, and other forms of humanitarian aid from entering the strip, meaning they are actively complicit in the deaths of civilians who are in dire need of aid and died as a result of lack of access to that aid that was waiting for them at the border but not allowed in. Not to mention the civilians who died as a result of the heavy bombings or under the rubble of buildings. I’m aware that recently they let a small number of aid trucks in, but my understanding is that the amount that was let in was less than what was let in on a daily basis before Oct 7. 

As for the human shield argument and the hiding amongst civilians tactic, I’m sure many are tired of this rebuttal— but usually you’re not supposed to kill the human shield. I do personally believe there are alternative ways we can weed out Hamas militants other than bombing the daylights out of historic buildings, apartments, universities, hospitals, and refugee camps. Didn’t we use ground tactics and special forces to raid and kill bin Laden, for example? I’m sure people will say that the situation was totally different, but i just feel like there has to be another way other than bombing densely populated areas that are guaranteed to have civilian casualties, not just might. How many civilian lives is a Hamas militant worth to you, genuinely? How many is too many? Is there ever a point where you would begin to question the legitimacy of Israel’s war tactics? These are questions i genuinely want you to think about and answer.

At this point they’ve laid more bombs on a 25 mile long strip of land than they dropped on Afghanistan in a year, and i fully understand people’s absolute hatred for the group that took the lives of so many amazing and important people that day; raining down absolute mayhem and carnage on the Palestinian civilians, however, is absolutely unacceptable and is not self defense, it’s collective punishment, which are sanctions or punishments enacted on a group for the actions or wrongdoings of a faction of that group. This is a war crime and should not be taken lightly by the general public. 

Lastly i really really urge you (if anyone has even read this far) to closely examine the language you use when referring to Palestinian civilians: in point 4 the OP described what happened on Oct 7 as an atrocity (which is absolutely true and the loss of any Israeli citizen is just as tragic as the loss of any Palestinian civilian- if you don’t think so you may also want to examine any biases of discrimination or hatred you might hold) but in point 3 OP says “civilians have died and will die because of the realities of urban warfare”, calling it “unfortunate” and going so far as to doubt the death statistics that have come out of Gaza, after the over 200 page list has been published releasing the names and ID#s of every person who died (up to this point). If anything, IMO, the numbers in actuality would be larger due to the amount of missing people under the rubble that have yet to be found. The fact that many people, and even news headlines, often say Palestinians “die” while Israelis were “killed” might seem like such a small innocent thing, but language is everything and these deaths are murders as well, that needs to be acknowledged. 

I’ll end with some final thoughts about Palestinian liberation, I’m sure many won’t read but this is mostly for my own healing as I’ve been leading my life with a very heavy heart for the past month, for obvious reasons. 90% of water in the Gaza Strip was undrinkable before Oct 7. Refugees make up 67% of Gazas demographic, likely a result of people being pushed out of their historic homes and relocated. Half of the population is under the age of 18 and as a result of this conflict, far too many have met their end in a horrific way (this is not to say that the attacks on Israeli citizens were not equally appalling, just to say that one atrocity does not permit another). The Palestinian people have the unalienable right to life as do all people, and the Palestinian people do not as a whole represent the morals and actions of Hamas, just as the US govt and the Israeli govt does not represent the interests of every citizen. I really hope that people will begin to approach this with more humanitarianism, the future looks bleak but with collective action i really do think we can intelligently and carefully reevaluate the situation and move forward with the right to life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in mind. These may be American ideals but everyone that hasn’t committed a war crime deserves all three. To the people who have also been leading their lives with heavy hearts, mourning the losses of the innocent, i see you and i send you my love.",2023-11-07 00:38:47

9594,"Bro do u live in mars. Each of your statements has been proven wrong numerously,and yet you are claiming them. Let me mlae them clear for u once again.

1. Firstly, I admit that hamas has its operation centers spreaded around public infra-structures. But that doesn't give isr*el the right to go on and bomb every one of them, knowing very well that not hamas workers but innocent civilians are gonna get murdered in numbers. This is not how u eradicate a militant group. Hamas has been formed by the help of few member states, mostly in association with iran. It has been restricted to the tiny Gaza strip since its formation. On the other hand, isr*el has one of the largest army, backed by the military super power USA. They've got the mosad. Can't they perform special operations in gaza to find out and eliminate Hamas members particularly. And they've coined the term 'self defence', keeping the iron dome in their back yard, protecting them from man-made hamas rockets.Hope i made my point. Besides u give a video created by the isr*eli officials about hamas operations underneath a hospital. Why should i believe this when u r publicly rejecting the numbers of deaths just cz it is controlled by hamas.
2.Isr*el trying to evacuate Gaza,lol funniest shit i heard in a long time. Evacuate them to where exactly. Should 2.3 million people just vanish into thin air? They're bombing people on the way to the south. Every place that Gazan took shelter in, isr*el is performing atrocities there, hospitals,refugee camps, unicef schools, and this is still not a genocide? I didn't know dropping fliers before bombing legalizes war crime. Besides blocking all paths to escape, they're closing all the routes for aid to pass. Now i got a question, if they're targeting only hamas, WHY ARE THEY NOT ALLOWING AID INTO GAZA? NO EQUIPMENTS IN THE HOSPITALS, NO FOOD WATER FIRST AID BOXES. THEY'VE CONCENTRATED 2.3 M PEOPLE INTO HALF OF GAZA, STRIPING THEM OF ALL BASIC NEEDS AND STILL U QUESTION IF ITS A GENOCIDE OR NOT???
3.This claim was made by biden himself and in reply, Palestinian health authorities released a 23 page long document, revealing names ages and identities of every death in Gaza. May i add the list keeps increasing every day. Kindly go and take a look that the FIRST SIX PAGES CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF INFANTS BELOW ONE YEAR. Where is hamas? Where is ur humanity?
4.OK hamas is holding fuel. But on what logic do u block them from civilians bro. The hospitals are running out, patients are dying from lack of treatment, communication is disruptesd. Again and aagin the world is focusing how the civilians are isra*ls main target. They want to empty gaza and build homes there over mass graves of children. If this doesn't seem like a genocide to u, maybe build up ur humanity once in a while.

Lastly, isr*el hasn't just been conducting this torture since 7oct, not since 2014, not since the formation of Hamas. Go read some history and you'll see how and why isr*el is oppressing Palestinians for 75 yrs. This genocide doesn't need much to grow humanity among people, try to study and be on the right side if history, else ur whole identity can become wrong.",2023-11-07 00:02:57

9612,"I am neither pro-Palestinian nor pro-Israel. What I do know is that the Palestinians have lived under a blockade, imposed and enforced by Israel, since 2007. Israel controls EVERYTHING that goes in and out of Gaza. The Palestinians cannot leave Gaza and, if they venture more than 3 miles off the coast, the Israeli Navy will blow them out of the water. They are prisoners. 

Also, keep in mind, the U.S. is the only nation in the world that supports Israel. The majority of the world, including the U.N., does not recognize the Israeli state and they hold the view that the Palestinians are living under apartheid. Look at that ""agreement"" in 1948 that gave those lands to Israel. The Palestinians never signed onto it. Never. 

And I am just having a fundamental problem with flattening Gaza. A lot of innocent people are getting wasted. I keep hearing that the Palestinians hate the U.S. and would kill us all if they had the chance. That is very unfortunate but I think I see why the Palestinians might hate us. Let's face it...
Israel is just an entitled U.S. territory, 
We fund them, 
We defend them, 
We arm them, and 
We allow them to commit what most people in the world consider to be genocide.

And don't think for a moment that, should Gaza be totally eliminated, that's the end of it. Israel also wants Iran to be gone. Anyone that has served in the military knows what ""mission creep"" is. The annihilation of Gaza is just the first step in what may be the next Holy War... or WW III at a minimum. Just let them work it out themselves. I don't give a shit who wins. Let's just let this play itself out.",2023-11-06 20:02:32
9613,"“It’s only thousands of people so it’s not genocide” 

Just by killing thousands of innocent civilians, Israel has sparked outrage in the world. From France all the way Japan, the world is starting to see Israel’s actions. There are already calls of ceasefire by the U.S, Israel’s biggest of its few allies.

Israel’s master plan is to drive the Palestinians into Egypt or take control of Gaza and commit horrible crimes like it does in the West Bank. Netanyahu just mentioned this today!",2023-11-07 02:57:17

OHHHH DO YOU MAKE MY BLOOD BOIL , AS MUCH AS WE LIKE THE JEWS AND CONSIDER THEM COUSINS, WE JUST LOATH YOU ZIONISTS, WE KNOW THAT JEWS OF THE MIDDLE EAST ARE NOT THE SAME AS EUROPEAN REFUGEES THAT RAN FROM HITLER.

9616,"The rhetoric that Israeli officials are using ist a textbook example of genocide rhetoric. Mainly the dehumanization of the palestinian people, who were refered to as ""Human animals"", most prominently by Yoav Gallant. 

Another thing that doesnt fit the narrative of minimizing civilian casualities are statements like ""The children of Gaza brought it upon themselves"" (Knesset member Merab Ben-Ari) and Isaac Herzog claiming that civilians are involved in it too. 
This, along with the very high amount of (mostly civilian) casualities is extremely alarming for anyone who studied the process of genocide.
