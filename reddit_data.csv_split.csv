0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"No videos of Israelis launching rockets at Gaza shouting ""god is great!"" while women and children die. Keep in mind, one side goes through great lengths to protect their women and children through the Iron Dome from wanton aggression. The other side hides their combatants behind their women and children, and that tells you almost everything you need to know."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,That's why we all feel like we are taking crazy pills! The goal of Hamas is to massacre Jews not establish a thriving Palestine state! Hamas and Hezbollah serve the interest of Iran.
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,Yes! That‚Äôs what people are forgetting because I grew up in the 80s where it was very very common for hamas To kidnap American citizens off the street in Beirut Lebanon. People have forgotten that.

I think Rabin got it right...

>""Until 1967, Israel did not hold an inch of the Sinai Peninsula and the West Bank, the Gaza Strip or the Golan Heights. Israel held not an acre of what is now considered disputed territory. And yet we enjoyed no peace.  
Year after year Israel called for pleaded for ‚Äî a negotiated peace with the Arab governments. Their answer was a blank refusal and more war... The reason was not a conflict over territorial claims. The reason was, and remains, the fact that a free Jewish state sits on territory at all.""

0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"I think it goes without saying that Hamas and Palestine are not the same thing. however, my understanding is Hamas was the ‚Äúelected‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know the circumstances of how that happened) government of Palestine and for the most part, no one speaks out against them. 
That all being said, I don‚Äôt see how anyone comes away from what just occurred in Gaza as a success or anything to be cheered, it‚Äôs one thing to ‚Äúfight the power‚Äù and be the rebels to the western empire, it‚Äôs another to target fully civilian populations and murder indiscriminately (thinking mainly about the music festival). It doesn‚Äôt help that some groups immediately jumped to ‚ÄúIsrael started it‚Äù rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don‚Äôt understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. 
I sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas‚Äô shoulders. I just wish I saw more Palestinian voices speaking out and decrying what took place/ condemning Hamas. Entirely possible I just haven‚Äôt seen those voices. 

Full Disclosure: this is my raw opinion on the matter, only got up to speed today on everything going on. I‚Äôm not saying this is 100% correct so if you have anything to add or correct, please feel free."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"regardless of who you ""support,"" the terrorists have committed heinous acts. If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn't listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"The Palestinian supporters on my social media are saying ‚ÄúIsraelis don‚Äôt care about their hostages because they are bombing Gaza (with a Hamas fighter here or there). Israel just wants destruction.‚Äù I was flabbergasted when I read that. First by saying so casually a Hamas fighter here or there bc Hamas actually did bomb a Gaza hospital so that‚Äôs their justification. And second, I promise as a non Palestinian Muslim woman posting that, if you were there in the country you would NOT be spared by Hamas even if you shared their religion. The supporters are protesting while going back to their comfy homes in the States not even comprehending that if Hamas was in the States, even if you supported their country for ‚Äúresisting against oppression‚Äù, they would literally not spare you."

15. Hamas declared after the Jews the will go after the ""treacherous Christians"""
1,02/11/2023 13:26:57,"We all hope for peace and a better day to come. Hamas actions are condemned, we‚Äôll likely see many being declared war crimes. We shouldn‚Äôt let those actions lower our humanity or morals or we become just as bad. 

I think some of your conclusions are rushed or need elaboration:
8 - they fear that there‚Äôll be a missed step later where those refugees can‚Äôt go home. Their stance is on Palestinian‚Äôs right to exist and to their homes (not Hamas but the civilians)
10 - currently there‚Äôs not really aid to steal (this one is likely partly propped by propaganda saying we shouldn‚Äôt send aid as Hamas will steal it all - we should still send aid).
11 - they weren‚Äôt quiet but you can‚Äôt really protest the past, you protest the current. We mourn and join the vigils to show solidarity after a horrific loss of life. Soon after that loss of life war began. If Israel wasn‚Äôt bombing right now, there‚Äôd definitely be more outcry against Hamas with even more protests focused on the hostages and bringing the perpetrators of those horrific acts to justice. As Israel has said that‚Äôs their aim, it‚Äôs easy for a collective to think those two goals are already in hand and don‚Äôt need the voices of people to make it happen."

Instead of life they worship death trying to meet a God that does not know them.

2,30/11/2023 11:41:16,"/r/Palestine actively banning anyone for calling Hamas terrorists is, to me, condoning the behavior of the terrorists that are Hamas.

Check out their braindead logic. Somehow hostages who have been actively taken with family members killed in front of them, should be grateful that Hamas fed them canned food. That place is full of idiots with gold medals in mental gymnastics."
2,30/11/2023 11:41:16,"people need to switch from free palestine to free palestine from hamas, i was there years back with the irc and i'll tell you this, i didn't see any genocide or israel colonization, i saw hamas suppressing the people, eating lots infront of starving kids, drinking plenty water infront of thirsty families, and see them beating up civilians when they got mad about food and water with them saying ""
you should thank us for protecting you from israel "" 

sorry but israel needs to destroy them and then go in and rebuild and help the people the way they want not how they want to, and bring love back to the people that one day maybe they can go "" maybe we can live beside them """

4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,"NYTimes already put out the post before verifying. Extremely dangerous and irresponsible. The damage is done. They‚Äôve updated their post to say it‚Äôs confirmed Hamas , but haven‚Äôt taken down the picture that says it was israel. Sad"
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,"IDF: An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit.

Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza."
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,"The truth is that, at the moment, nobody knows. We can be fairly certain that whoever did it, did it by accident.

With that being said, circumstantial evidence points to a misfired rocket from within Gaza, and that is the likelier accident.


* Rockets were being fired minutes before the impact from the southwest of the hospital, over the hospital

* Third parties have recorded the direction and triangulated the likely source

* Beyond ""Hamas said so,"" there is no tracking of a missile from Israel or evidence of Israeli involvement 

* Israel's munitions are precisely guided and accounted for, and Israel has no reason to airstrike this hospital 

* Palestinian militants' munitions have a 30% misfire rate,  are essentially unguided and are generally fired from densely populated urban areas

* Occam's razor makes it clear which premise is more reasonable. 

It's quite possible it's an Israeli mistake and they're just super lucky in circumstantial evidence to cover it up, but it's a lot less likely than the straightforward explanation that fits the data; it was a mistake made within Gaza, by Gazans."
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,"First there‚Äôs video proof of the failed rocket launch (something that happens quite a lot in Gaza, approximately 20-25% of launches from Gaza fail and land back in their territory) you can clearly see the rocket changing its course and making its way to the hospital with a following big explosion, if it were IDF◊≥s air strike you wouldn‚Äôt even see the missle approaching in the slightest, another argument id like to address is the narrative being spread that we just rain bombs on Gaza like maniacs. First of all before any attack on Gaza the residents of the area are notified that the building or area is to be bombed, they even send maps with the marked bombing area and instructions on where are the safe areas for them to evacuate to while dropping flyers from planes with clear instructions in Arabic (The Israeli prime minister has told the people of Gaza live on television to please evacuate themselves so no innocent lives are being taken) So do y‚Äôall really think a country going out of her way to help the innocent lives of the people in Gaza will do all of that just so they can bomb a hospital full to the brim with patients? This is a far fetched reality with no ground for it to stand on. Another subject I‚Äôll talk about shortly is the fact that many people are not happy with israel cutting the supply of fuel,water and electricity to Gaza, how can you expect Israel to even consider to keep supplying these kind of resources to a someone that declared war on it? How can you expect any kind of humanitarian assistance to be provided when they slaughtered, butchered and burned alive Israel‚Äôs innocent civilians?"
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,It was verified with a video hamas failed to launch a rocket which fell on the hospital
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,Hamas misfired rocket
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,">If this gets verified as Hamas, I hope the world finally realises who and what Israel are dealing with.

I don't see this happening, people really like to blame Israel even with all the evidence in the world............

As everyone i don't know for sure, i hope my country didn't do this because we are better than this, and if we did there should be a god damn explanation because it makes us all look terrible."
4,17/10/2023 19:39:04,I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this was a deliberate attack to gain international support. Only Hamas is capable of such actions.

5,26/11/2023 05:33:35,"Anyone who has seen footage from October 7th and the videos of the female hostage with blood soaked shorts knows this is an act, a facade and a theater production.  Hamas calls Jews dogs and enjoys torturing and mutilating.  

Are there individual members who may be nicer than others?  Maybe.  Hard to say.

The anti Israel crowd will grasp at any footage of any evidence to advance their position. Same reason so many are now pushing the notion that it was a false flag, or it was Israeli choppers killing civilians or that forty babies were not beheaded therefore everything else is fake.  Getting anyone to change their mind despite evidence to the contrary is simply impossible."
5,26/11/2023 05:33:35,"The ‚ÄúHamas with a heart of gold‚Äù narrative is the most enraging propaganda campaign of this entire conflict. Anyone with more than a few brain cells knows it‚Äôs fake, but the ignorant masses will believe anything they see and our enemies know this & exploit it. I will never forget how I laughed at the absurdity when I first saw the banana lady interview in the early days. Then the feelings of utter hopelessness when I saw how many people believed it. Social media will be the demise of society."
5,26/11/2023 05:33:35,"Hamas apologists, really tragic."
5,26/11/2023 05:33:35,"You know Israel has prepared a huge team of psychologists and emotional support for the hostages for when they'll be back and one of them was interviewed and was asked how to prepare to support the hostages once they are here.

The psychologist responded ""we will do what we can, but unfortunately there is no literature for that sort of thing since there are no known cases of children hostages who were captive for so long"""
5,26/11/2023 05:33:35,I think everyone forgets they kidnapped these people and killed their family right in front of them.

Hamas ARE terrorists!"
5,26/11/2023 05:33:35,"I‚Äôm pro Palestine and yeah I think Hamas being ‚Äúnice‚Äù to the hostages is bs and probably just a PR move. Even if the Hamas members were kind or friendly or kept the hostages well taken care of, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs in their best interest to behave that way. Having hostages as bargaining chips is useful, and if they keep them in good condition then the public will be more sympathetic towards them. But they were still hostages kidnapped by a group of armed and dangerous militants. This doesn‚Äôt make Hamas ‚Äúgood‚Äù."
6,27/11/2023 09:59:23,"It‚Äôs important to also remember just how oppressive Hamas is towards Palestinians as well. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some Gazans claim to support Hamas out of fear.

6,27/11/2023 09:59:23,"If Hamas were ""freedom fighters"" with any principals they would execute at least some of their fighters who killed children and raped women. Or they could give them to the Israelis to show they aren't just like ISIS.

What do you think would happen to someone who handed a hostage back to IDF during active war? I understand why this is extremely frustrating and off-putting to people, but these civilians have been subjected to decades of incomplete/inaccurate reporting of events, general brainwashing, and violent strong-arm tactics. I'd be afraid to even honestly answer a poll in a place like this, and that's if all the lies hadn't skewed my understanding first. They are still civilians."
6,27/11/2023 09:59:23,"I have no doubt in my mind that Gazans who just want peace with Israel exist but I don't believe that's 50% of them. I have no evidence to support this thought but from what I've read and seen so far, they seem pretty rare.

I think people who throw around numbers like ""only 57% of Gazans support Hamas"" overlook the possibility that this could easily mean the other 43% support a different terrorist group with similar or even more radical ideas.

I could vote for a white supremacist party but eventually lose trust in them because they still haven't managed to kick out all the immigrants and give my next vote to a party that's even more racist. These statistics lack context."

Go to Palestinian Media Watch (palwatch), and you will find chilling and disturbing videos, like of a young girl doing a stabbing demo. There are videos of students calling to kill Jews.

There are some silly answers to that but not anything serious that cant be refuted easily."
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,"I've asked the same questions to many folks, some of the answers I've received, and my response to them.  


* Israel should take in special forces like the US did with Osama. 
   * **My response:** the US started TWO wars (not just one) after Osama. It took them 10 years, while killing tens of thousands of civilians, to take out Osama. Israel's casualties are much more targeted. Interesting how the world only remembers the recent activities
* They took out Hitler with special forces and not mass casualties
   * **My response**: Tbh this was so ridiculous I couldn't even. I mentioned that there was a 6year WORLD war (not just between 2 countries), that Hitler killed himself blah blah but I doubt I got my point across
* Israel should not target journalists and bakeries (referring to the incidents of the Al Jazeera reporter and the bakery in WB they dismantled)
   * **My response**: This is awful and yes Israel should not have done it

My guess is most people who are anti-Hamas and pro-Palestine (and I'd like to believe a lot are) would love for Israel to do some sort of ""special operation"" with their great military and take down only the terrorists. They have likely had ideas of this from movies/shows etc. The current issue that this is NOT possible because Hamas has embedded itself deep amongst the civilians is something people don't get"
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,Wait this is a genuinely good question but there has only been one straight answer so far.
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,Shouldn't the answer be for Hamas to not use civilians as shields?
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,How exactly? Since Hamas is like ISIS they use palestinians as shields.
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,"They don't care about Jewish/Israeli lives. At that point it's: You must stop the attacker if a Palestinian child gets caught in the crossfire, even if it endanger Israelis"
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,"This is why everything the pro Palestine people say is really not a lot more than Hamas propaganda. If it were that easy, there would not still be a Hamas. They strike and then retreat back into the city to blend in so that Israel has no way of knowing where they are, and so that Israel has to kill as many innocents as possible to get any of them. It‚Äôs also why none of the rest of the Middle East will take Palestinian refugees, because they need the people there to give the insurgency something to blend in with. This is the endgame for their bronze-age death cult‚Äôs version of the apocalypse. None of this is Israel‚Äôs fault, and it‚Äôs okay to not feel bad for Palestinians any more."
7,30/10/2023 11:41:58,"Asking Hamas to put a military uniform and be a military entity. It is not the case, they dont do it and I think will never do it. Not touching the civilian population in this case like a normal war is really hard to do. It is sad for palestinian but to like it or not, it is a war and in a war civilian get caught in the middle.

We recently saw a lot of Gazan opinions and criticism of Hamas, and even protests... And remember, freedom of speech is a western privilege: most countries don't have the freedom to protest or to complain, and the safest thing to do is to keep your head down and pretend you agree with the regime.

That said... I was disgusted by the civilians in Gaza cheering on or even involved in the attacks on the 7th of October.

It's hard to know whether or not they're compelled not to object via force or if there's actually that much support for them. Reports of anti-Hamas protests from inside the Gaza strip have indicated that they don't end well for the protesters.

Outside Gaza? There has been a lot of weird, leftist indoctrination in Western universities over the last few decades. People have been conditioned to see Hamas' actions as legitimate resistance to oppression.

The core problem is this. We, in the West, do not see Palestinians. We simply don't. We don't hear from the Palestinians in Hebron who are subjected to humiliating occupation. We don't know anything about the Palestinian children who are pulled from rubble after Israeli air strikes. We can't avoid seeing them now.

I see the frizzy haired Israeli-Jewish girl, who could be my daughter, and I know she may never come home to her family. I weep.

14,16/10/2023 17:43:21,"The American left believes that it supports underdogs, so people on the left often support Palestinians, who are perceived as underdogs.

Facts that go against this entrenched narrative that Palestinians are underdogs are  ignored by leftists: like the fact that Palestinians are supported by 1.9 billion fellow Muslims, that Israel is a tiny country whose existence has been under threat since its inception and continues to be under threat, due to hostility from neighboring states, that Palestinians elected the theocratic terror group Hamas to represent them and still continue to support the terror group. If anything, it is Israel that is the underdog.

If you think about it, the ideology of Hamas is exactly what American leftists say they oppose: Hamas is theocratic, misogynistic, homophobic, and intolerant of all other religions - just like the Christian Nationalists in the US that the left is opposed to. But because of anti-Israel propaganda and entrenched, ahistorical narratives about Israel on the left, leftists lose sight of these inconvenient facts about the Israel-Palestine conflict and automatically side with Palestinians no matter how gruesome the Palestinians' actions are."
14,16/10/2023 17:43:21,">I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as  guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence

Wholly disagree. It is in my opinion distinctly different when discussing Gaza. Israel's actions regarding Gaza as for the most part fully defensive (think Iron Dome) while Hamas is fully offensive. When Israel retaliates against Hamas during times of more serious terrorist attacks (such as this current one) there is a clear focus on disabling Hamas capabilities and targeting known terrorists. Yes, there are civilian casualties, but I would contend that many of them are likely due to Hamas keeping its civilians where they are, potentially against the civilians' will. Israel gives forewarning to residents of buildings before they will strike. On the other hand, Hamas' obvious goal is the total annihilation of Israel and all Jews worldwide. We saw this in action last week and are lucky that their ""call to violence"" did not lead to widespread violence around the globe (with the few small exceptions we've heard about). It's just not the same when you look at each entity's goals and actions.

As for your main point, it really is one of the best examples of cognitive dissonance I've ever seen. It really is like that [Eric Andre meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1959067874127057&set=p.1959067874127057&type=3). It is so obviously Hamas that is the root of so many problems pertaining to Gaza but so many don't see it this way. There are a few driving factors that I believe have led to Gazan support by the left:

* **9/11 and Islamophobia** \- Ever since 9/11, the US opinion towards Islam, Muslims, and the Middle East has been rough. Not saying it isn't somewhat justified but it has lead to serious racism towards Muslims in America. The far left has always been fighting against this, but in their fight, they have blindly swung to support all things that appear to look like resistance to American (or white) imperialism in the ME. By making Israel appear as a imperialist, white, and warmongering country, many leftists side with Gazans as a force of habit at this point.
* **Poor knowledge** \- This goes for both sides but I'm focusing on the left for now since this post is about them. In this day and age, rarely anyone reads past the headline of an article or gets their news from Instagram stories. This is a very bad way at understanding the situation and the history surrounding it. The left's love for making nice-wrapped-up Instagram posts trying to explain the conflict in a few infographics gives people a sense of understanding of the conflict and leaves them with a bad case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. IMO the more people understand the history of Israel, its ties to Jewish people and the circumstances of how it was formed and how Gaza came to be, the more likely they are to not take such a strong pro-Palestinian side. 
* **Cognitive Dissonance** \- I honestly don't know how else to put it that this. Seeing signs of ""Gays for Palestine"" or ""Feminists for Palestine"" really makes me scratch my head. The support coming from these groups without the realization that if they were to openly be themselves or speak about these topics in Gaza, they would most likely be stoned on the spot. I think certain groups who see themselves as marginalized in the US (LGBT+, Atheists, African Americans) think there are similarities between their beliefs and what the average Gazan's beliefs are. What they do not realize is how essentially no Gazan would rush to defend a homosexual if the tables were turned.

I could go on about Israel's right-wing, corrupt government and how that likely plays are role but my comment is long enough. As a left-winger myself, it brings me so much more pain to see the left dive into their own brand of anti-Semitism compared to the right's old and tired antisemitism."
14,16/10/2023 17:43:21,"Completely agree with this. Thank you for articulating the way I‚Äôve been feeling and thinking. As a liberal Jewish person, I wish discourse didn‚Äôt force you to take an all or nothing approach to stating support or sharing opinions."
14,16/10/2023 17:43:21,"This is something I read once. It is not original thought, but I think it explains a lot about the differences between the left and right.

The left frames issues in terms of the oppressed and the oppressor. The right looks at things in terms of order and chaos. The right doesn't like chaos. That's why they generally don't like protests and side with the police. The left sides with the protesters, because they they appear to be oppressed by the police and the system.

Obviously, there is a lot of grey area and just like right and left, there is a spectrum.

Israel, like the Jewish people, were once seen as oppressed. We are no longer the oppressed, and in their eyes, we have become the oppressors.

I also think that the left to define the oppressed and the oppressor based on skin color. That's why the narrative of Jews being white Europeans is so key to the Palestinian cause."

1. The officer in the picture is probably from the special unit - Sayeret Golani. These people are highly trained and very unlikely to do something like that.
2. The footprint next to the deceased head is not from an IDF shoe. These are standardised by  manufacturers.
3. In 2016 an IDF solider headshot a neutralised terrorist. The whole thing became a scandal, the solider was released from the IDF and was prosecuted. Do you think the IDF is just shooting people? Fine, find a precedence 

None of these are any proof, just some more context and background."
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"The options are:
1. IDF cold blooded killed him
2. He was caught in the middle of a gun fight between IDF and Hamas
3. He was killed by Hamas

The first option is very unlikely.
The second seems more likely.
The third is a possibility, but it requires more information."
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"The 2 sides claim that the other side is lying. Who will you believe?  To a terrorist organization that has nothing to lose, or to a Western country that advocates ""live and let live""?

Start listening to other Gazan voices, those who do not support Hamas, and see what they have to say.

In Israel you also hear about people raising their voice against the government, protests in the streets, going out in public against ministers.  

Now, what do you hear from Gaza?

And if you don't hearit from Gaza, does that mean it doesn't exist? Or are they just afraid of the government they themselves ""elected"" with a majority of 85%?

Israel is the only one that really cares about the citizens in Gaza.  
True, the 7th of October shook it up a bit.  But they are still the only ones who take care of them for work, food, living, electricity, water, and protect them from their own government!

Think how much money Gaza receives from Arab countries.  Why should Israel provide them with electricity instead of them investing in green energy? 
Why should Israel provide them with water instead of them investing in the treatment of sea water?

Anyone who is not in Gaza or Israel and supports Hamas - is harming the people of Gaza!!!"
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,I'm more likely to believe Hamas executed him for cooperating with IDF soldiers
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,You can clearly see that the idf soldier helps the man to walk in the picture..its just another Palestinian lie
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"Just a reminder, Yahya sinwar nicknamed ""the butcher of khan yunis"", after he cutted between 4 to 20 plus people, all of them but 2 were Palestinians.
The people he killed were theoretically collaborating with the idf."
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"Israel has absolutely no reason to kill him, also there is no proof at all that they did (that I saw so far), either he isn‚Äôt dead or Hamas killed his for appearing with Israelis and to attempt and make it seem they did it.

If you think for a moment and not let idiots misinform you, Israel has opened safe passage for thousands of people, fed and gave water to many, why kill him? To what benefit?

Either it‚Äôs not the same person / staged
Or Hamas killed him 
99.9999%"
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"My main question would be did Israel have any benefit in killing him? 

Because Hamas obviously has, but I can't see a reason for Israeli forces to shoot him"
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"I keep hearing the claim that both sides are lying.
Yet i havent seen any proof of the IDF spokesperson lying.
Do you have any?
If not, then I think ita more accurate to say that one side is lying because there is an abundance of proof that Hamas lies."
16,15/11/2023 00:22:35,There's a never ending barrage of anti Israel misinformation on social media
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"It‚Äôs a completely valid question and everybody, especially Palestinians and Palestinian supporters, should just answer it and say they condemn Hamas‚Äô Oct 7th attacks. Do pro-Palestine activists have no understanding of PR and how the rest of the world feels about terrorists and terrorist sympathizers? The world just had their newsfeed filled with a barrage of tapes of Hamas militants savagely massacring entire families of innocent civilians and then of pro-Palestine activists marching in the street seemingly praising it. That makes them see all Palestinians and Palestinian supports as being pro-terror. As being somebody that could happily massacre them at worst, or celebrate others massacring them at best. 

They need to show the rest of the world that there is a huge difference between Hamas terrorists and Palestinian civilians/Palestinian supporters, that they do not share the same values and are not all violent evil people. People aren‚Äôt going to care about the plight of groups who want them and their families dead. Without condemnations and basic humanity from the Palestinian side of the debate, the rest of the world will see them all the same way they see Hamas and have no sympathy for the Gazan civilians dying or the Palestinian activists being doxxed and fired. 

If you want people to care about you and respect your opinion and see you as a human being, you have to show you have humanity too. 

I can 110% unequivocally say I condemn Hamas for the terror attack of 10/7 but that I‚Äôm also heartbroken over the death of every innocent Palestinian and condemn any and all violence against non-combatant civilians. It isn‚Äôt that hard to just be a human being."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"Because it's a litmus test by which folk gauge whether or not to engage in further discussion with you. It's an easy question and determines whether or not your definition of ""civilians"" includes Israelis shot in their homes or while attending a music festival. 

Inability to condemn Hamas prevents more nuanced discussion of the topic."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"But like, why cant you condemn Hamas? Why do you refuse to do so? You are making a deliberate choice by refusing to do it. Why?"
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"Just point out out that Hamas has no intention of land dispute but it‚Äôs about destroying Israel

https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/379525"
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"I think the main reason people throw this question at you is because the general feeling is that the proportion of condemnation between Israel and Hamas is just not right.

In other words - what we choose to **focus** on in a certain time and place is part of the message itself. 

By focusing on Israel's actions at this time, we are effectively diverting the discussion away from the real culprit of the violence in the region, and the only agent that can make it stop for real -  Hamas, as well as the attitude that it promotes, which is also prevalent in Judea and Samaria."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"I agree, people can be rigid when talking about politics. But I think what people are challenging is the notion that pro-Palestinian = anti Israel. 

Who has hindered the Palestinian dream to have their own state and live peacefully? Is it truly the Jews and Israel? Or is it Arab leaders and Palestinian leaders? They are asking you to think critically and look at history. Hamas will direct the responsibility to Israel when in fact, they hold the majority of the responsibility for the Palestinians people‚Äôs hardship. Not all. Israel can certainly do better. But Hamas makes is more difficult for Israel to make choices that will be beneficial for the Palestinian people."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,">Why can‚Äôt I be neither

You can be neither. You can also be pro Israel and pro Palestine at the same time. Just don't be pro Hamas.

I personally refuse to have conversations with people who look at Oct. 7th and can't say ""This was a horrible massacre that should never happen again"". If a person doesn't have basic human decency to admit that, then I have nothing else to say or hear from him.

For a conversation to happen there needs to be at least some minimal foundation both sides can agree on. I can't find that foundation with people who support Hamas.

If you support palestine, you're against Israeli policies against Palestinians etc. That's fine. We can at least agree to condemn Hamas."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"And Hamas leadership has been pretty clear that this isn‚Äôt a land dispute, it‚Äôs about killing Jews. Never again means never again, and I hope Israel kills every last member of Hamas."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"I get your point, and it's fair, and frustrating. But I wish people would ask me if I condemn Netanyahu, or the current Israeli government, instead of arguing with me that Israel shouldn't exist."
17,01/11/2023 09:50:24,People use a pro-Palestinian stance to condemn Israel so this question seeks to get to the heart of whether you‚Äôre truly looking for peace or just a ‚Äòpeace‚Äô that prevents Israel‚Äôs legitimate defence.
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"Everyone in Gaza isn‚Äôt Hamas, but the government, military and infrastructure has all been commandeered by Hamas for their war effort. What‚Äôs happening Gaza is heartbreaking and should never have come to be. Yahya Sinwar played Russian roulette with the lives of 2.3 million people."
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"According to the latest survay done in the west bank and Gaza, by the Palestinians, mre than 80% of the people in the west bank say 7/10 was justified and more than 60% in Gaza say it even now, so not all of the Palestinians are Hamas but most still are.

Dismissing everything the Israel or any Israeli say as propaganda and assuming it is false as a result is just a joke, believe what you want, we know the truth."
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"That's because all information that comes out of Palestine has to go through/answer to Hamas.  


They will not allow you to publish anything that makes them look bad, they have their own influencers, and they likely make propaganda films disguises as civilian and/or force civilians to say certain things on video"
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"You see the same thing in r/Palestine, r/arabs, r/AskMiddleEast

Don't forget, there was a ceasefire on October 6th!!"
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"As many others have said, the same applies to the other side but even more so.
  
Every video that shows proof of Hamas tunneling under hospitals, firing from hospitals or setting up base in hospitals is just written off as staged and ‚ÄúIDF propaganda‚Äù. 
  
For God‚Äôs sake, they‚Äôre calling the body cam footage of Hamas committing their atrocities on the 7th, video they proudly took and put out there, IDF propaganda."
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"> Why can nothing just be what it is and not Hamas

Because it is what it is because hamas.  Critique idf all you want, but remember, they wouldn't even be in gaza right now if it wasn't for hamas."
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"> I'm so confused by the amount of Pro-Israel people that will call anything propaganda.

.
To be fair there are much larger amounts of Pro-Palestinian people that will call anything propaganda.

Theres shit on both sides."
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,"Its actually quite simple.
Not everyone in Gaza is Hamas, but anyone who holds any type of power is Hamas or under control of Hamas.
This includes reporters and doctors.
Im not saying that they neccesaarily personally hold the views of Hamas (although many do). Im just saying that all their decisions and actions are mandated by Hamas.
Thats how authoritarian states work, especially states that are run by terror orgs."
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,It‚Äôs Hamas fault that those people are dead because they use them as human shields and don‚Äôt let them evacuate. They‚Äôve on record said the more civilians dead the better because it garners sympathy from people like you.
18,16/11/2023 18:05:36,There could be a world where the Arabs and Israelis live peacefully together. That goal will be achieved when all the anti-each other groups are gone. When there are no more terrorist org. when there are no more radical politicians. Israel will set down their guns when the Arabs set down theirs.
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,"Here‚Äôs our truce: Release all hostages back to Israel and we‚Äôll stop bombing you. Surrender all remaining Hamas forces and you can have electricity/power back. Establish a government that recognizes Israel and denounces terror, and we‚Äôll ease the blockade so you can actually make something out of Gaza. 

Kapish? No? Then in a few weeks, Gaza will become Israel‚Äôs largest open air parking lot."
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,"Love this post. 

Watching Speak the Truth right now and the IDF made a statement something like ""they act like barbarians and will be handled as such"" üíÄ

If I were in Gaza I'd literally swim away if I had to in order to avoid what's coming."
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,"AKA ""Time out guys, I'm reloading!""."
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,You don't start something like this just to call a truce.
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,"Oh, I bet so. Wouldn't that be nice if Israel says, ""Ok"". The \~1000 murderers who did this didn't really think why this hadn't been done before. Now, as the Israelis hunt them down, civilians will bear the brunt of the casualties. You can't hit a rocket site next to an apartment building without killing the people in the apartment building. It doesn't really work that way in real life. 10 Palestinians will die for every Israeli slaughtered. It will get very messy, and that is if the Israelis don't start a new regional war with Iran before it is over. Hamas's main supporter is Iran after all. Stupid, stupid people."
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,hamas also just said 'if you keep bombing we will perform televised beheadings of the people we captured'.   you can't have truce talks when you steal people from a country.  these are ransom talks.  they likely want 100 terrorists back in exchange for 1 israeli civilian.
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,"Hamas: (attacks Israel) 

Hamas: ""no Peace"" üò°

Israel: (starts eliminating the terrorist)

Hamas: ""maybe just a bit of peace"" üòÖ"

19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,"Unless they release every last hostage, Israel isn‚Äôt stopping. And they know/knew this too 

Hamas hates Israel and hates Jews. But they also don‚Äôt care for their own. They use them in their jihad and it‚Äôs heartbreaking"
19,09/10/2023 19:00:26,They should have thought about that before they killed my neighbors.
