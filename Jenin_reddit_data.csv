IsraelPalestine,Jenin is NOT a refugee camp,,04/07/2023 06:49:50,"It’s important to understand that Jenin camp is not a “refugee” camp and the Palestinians in it aren’t “refugees” either. It's just a neighborhood of the city of Jenin. Is Manchester or Brooklyn a refugee camp?

&#x200B;

It's been 75 years and Palestinians have received billions of dollars in funding. Moreover, PA is in control of Area A, not Israel.

This victim caricature of the ""innocent"" Palestinian refugee is intended to play on Western sentimentalist thinking without any regard for the reality that Palestinians claim descendants of descendants are “refugees” no matter where they live and what citizenship they have — the only group to have such a definition. By that logic, everyone is a refugee because their parents, grandparents, or great grandparents were probably from somewhere else.","['Jenin is the ancient city of Ganim mentioned in the Bible.  Today it houses about 40,000 people; complete with an industrial zone, retail shops, etc.\n\nNext to Jenin is the Jenin Refugee Camp, which houses about 10,000 people, who are descendants of displaced Arabs from the 1948 War. \n\nThere are about 300 armed fighters in the RC.  Israel has the identities and arrest warrants for 160 of them— they are who Israel is currently fighting.', "">Palestinians claim descendants of descendants are “refugees” no matter where they live and what citizenship they have — the only group to have such a definition. By that logic \n\nBy that logic the Jews have been refugees for 2,000 years and Muslims in the 8th century didn't ask for permission when conquering (butchering Jews as part of some conflict back then) & settling the land"", 'Exactly. By that logic, all of Israel should be considered a refugee camp, since there are descendants of refugees from all over the world living there.', 'Honestly as someone in the west looking in it shameful how palistine would rather use dead kids as media tools rather than work toward fixing the problems with terrorists', 'Whew.

Refugee status is only passed down from the father not the mother.\n\nSo you can have a man born in Kuwait and lives in LA married an American woman of Scott Irish decent and those kids are palestinian refugees. But a woman born in Ramalah who married an Egyptian, kids wouldn't be considered refugees."", 'Well said - thank you!', 'People that had roots and homes in Haifa, Yaffa and other Palestinian cities, were removed from their homes for Israeli cities. Where do you think they went? Some fled to Lebanon (the southern parts where Israeli orchestrated massacres like Sabra and Shatilla took place.) Others fled to Jordan and Egypt. Others fled to other parts like Jenin. \n\nWhen an illegal settlement goes up, usually means people were removed before. Where do those people go? \n\nSo some of the people that live in Jenin fled, in 48, some fled in 67, some fled weeks ago when villages were destroyed. \n\nSo ya, after 75 years of taking refugee there, they built basic things like hospitals, roads, and infrastructure. All of which the Israeli military is destroying in recent weeks. \n\nLol like come on - the justification of this blood lust by saying: “not a refugee camp” “not civilians but militants” in this SR is appalling and makes complete sense why the Israeli government represents the Israeli people.']"
IsraelPalestine,"Israeli forces storm Jenin, kill two boys.",,30/11/2023 01:46:26,"So let me preface this by saying I am pro-Israel. I was initially very left in respect to this conflict, but after the attack on 10/7 I got significantly more invested and I have changed my view point. That's irrelevant, I just don't want people on me for opinions that I do not have.  I have recently watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjmNPgeuZmo  
I know NBC has some bias, but I trust that what they report is mostly accurate. I was bothered by what the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) did in a recent situation. At first, I doubted the info because it came from the Palestinian Health Administration, thinking it might be connected to Hamas and not very reliable. But, I later found out that the organization is completely separate from Hamas, changing my view and making me see their reports as more trustworthy. This shift in understanding makes me reconsider my initial doubts and recognize the reliability of the organization's reporting.  
While I do see one boy lighting what could be a fire-cracker, I do not believe that warrants him being shot at, and I do not understand why the 8-year-old had to die either. I'm just curious as to what is Israel's justification for this, and how can they afford to carry out operations like these in the middle of a conflict with Gaza, as I do not understand to why this city is particularly relevant, and this incident seems to only lower Israeli reputation.

IsraelPalestine,For those of you who stand with Israel: how was Jenin a “targeted attack”,,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"EDIT: I’m just asking what people think, not looking to be challenged and not asking for a “lesson.” I made this post but it’s because I wanted to know what people think, because it doesn’t resonate with me, not so people could pick it apart and tell me why I’m wrong. This sub is for conversations like these… I don’t know why it’s so inflammatory that on a Israel/Palestine sub someone would have a differing opinion, but ok! 

Long post: trying to cover alot of bases so the question can be addressed, not the history of the region, how other Arab countries “should take responsibility,” and asking me for sources just to be told that they “don’t count.” Not trying to bait an argument, but I am genuinely curious how Israel supporters really see Jenin as fair and measured. 


As an Arab (Jordanian-Palestinian) living in the US, I’ve read a lot the past week about how this was a “targeted attack” and no Palestinians who weren’t terrorists were affected… but on top of it being really unfair that all Palestinians have to pay for the actions of a few, civilians likely did die (considering the handful of children who were killed) and were injured and fact: the city is in shambles with no water, electricity, or internet. Homes and shops of those who had nothing to do with this were destroyed, and streets and alleys (infrastructure) have been torn up. 

Personally, I don’t support Hamas, or other terror orgs, and I don’t directly know anyone who does. And the PA is just a proxy for the Israeli government- this is a very popular sentiment, and it’s pretty well known in the region that this is how Palestinians by and large feel.

Israeli commentators have even noted that while this was a “successful operation” it has no bearing on long-term affairs in the West Bank, and Netanyahu made a statement that we will be seeing a lot more of these types of operations. 

With access to some of the most sophisticated military technology in the world, and seemingly knowing where to drop bombs, houses to specifically level, etc. as Israel claimed, and with the knowledge that this will have no long term effect on resistance activity in the West Bank, why was this necessary? So, it kind of seems like this is ramped up violence and the collective punishment as a whole under the guise of a “counter terrorism” operation. 

At this point I am curious about how supporters of Israel continue to support this while claiming defense. The escalation in violence seems to reflect the scorched earth policy of the current regime, which is being heavily criticized by the west… However, I’ve seen a lot of folks when asked this getting either a) defensive or b) nationalistic and completely denying that although this specific operation was to “target”terrorism, in the process they destroyed a whole town and effected the entire population. 

This is not an invitation to tell me how Palestinians have a country and its Jordan, all Palestinians are terrorists, or to counter the fact that the Palestinian people were indeed affected. But I get them thrown in my face a lot when I’m asking “hey, genuinely curious- why do you think this is okay?” 

I just would really like for someone to explain how actions like these are targeted or fair and how you see it as not intrusive to Palestinians by and large. This isn’t an ask for a history lesson l, I just want to hear why people who support think this is justified. Maybe you understand the impact and are still fine with it. Maybe you think things are going too far. I don’t know, but I’d like to understand without going back to the 40’s to argue about origins because this is the situation on the ground right now. 

In case anyone wants to ask for “sources” I’ll just include some bc apparently every Reddit post on this needs a bibliography. I tried to select “credible” sources.

As a Palestinian poster you are doing a really excellent job in trying to keep this conversation focused and directed on your desired topic.  Good job!\n\n(u/Distinct-Maybe719)', '[removed]', 'First we have to establish what the goal of the operation was: to degrade the capability of the terror organisations in Jenin and ensure more freedom of operation for the IDF there.\n\nJenin has really become a hotbed for militancy, especially over the last year and a half, with there being a build up of capability in the city and also IED’s and whatnot being a threat which made it hard for the IDF to operate in the area. This operation focused on degrading the capabilities of the groups, which we saw with the destruction of command centres, an explosives laboratory, the seizure of explosive devices and other weapons. We also saw the IDF trying to clear IED’s from the area, which is what we saw them doing to the streets.\n\nYou have characterised the operation as some all-encompassing, indiscriminate attack, but every Palestinian killed was claimed as a terrorist by their respective groups. The operations do impact civilians, and that’s a terrible thing, but it’s the terror groups who choose to hide themselves amongst the civilian population, the onus for what happens next is on them', 'Lots of comments already and you’re doing a great job responding to them all.  I’ll just add my two cents, both from the perspective of an Israel supporter and, probably more importantly, from (non-IDF) military experience.\n\nI think “targeted” in this context means something very different than it would in ordinary English.  Urban warfare in a densely populated place like Jenin is so difficult and dangerous that it is hard to accurately describe in a way that will do it justice.  Any military’s priority is to accomplish the mission with minimum casualties — meaning casualties on your side, not the other side.  Casualties on the other side should be minimized to the extent possible, but not at the risk of endangering our own side.  \n\nSo the ordinary military calculus for an operation like Jenin generally leads to one conclusion: aerial bombardment to eliminate targets at maximum distance and with the least risk to your own units.  In other words, flatten the place.  Israel could easily do so, and mission accomplished.\n\nBut Israel doesn’t want to do that for lots of political and genuinely held humanitarian reasons.  As a result, Israel fights the Palestinian militant organizations with both hands and one foot tied behind its back.  (To be clear, the US would not do this if it were in Israel’s position.)  Instead of flattening Jenin, the IDF went in with ground units supported by armor and some air support to take out specific targets.  This is an unbelievably risky thing to do, they didn’t have to do it, but it seems to have gone relatively well all things considered.  That there appear to have been only two non-combatant fatalities during the whole operation is nothing short of miraculous, in my opinion.\n\nSo anyways, “targeted” is a relative term.  Was it “targeted” in terms of impacting only the people actually responsible for terror attacks in Israel?  Definitely not.  Jenin is trashed and more than 100 people were injured.  But was it “targeted” in terms of killing only the people Israel actually meant to kill?  Overwhelmingly yes, at least in comparison to any of the other strategic options Israel might have chosen.', ""We can't deny that the daily lives of Jenin's residents got affected by the operation. However, when more than 50 attacks launched from Jenin, plus the murder of Israeli civilians which also affected Israel and daily lives of its citizens - no one questioned the actions. No mainstream international media coverage. No criticism by the west (Please correct me if I am wrong). How can the attack not intrusive to Israelis? \n\nI hope the people who condemned the operation could also give suggestions on ways to do it differently with similar effectiveness. We are talking about an armed group who were pointing guns at them, and hiding weapons, explosives in public places such mosque to be used to kill Israeli civilians. The people who condemn the Israelis actions, their countries would do 10x worser if they face similar attack.\n\nLives lost are tragic, no matter it's Israeli or Palestinian. We can't talk about being fair when we ignore the attack and killing of Israeli civilians perpetrated by the armed group from Jenin."", 'Harboring terrorists, willfully or not, has consequences. In this case those consequences were property and infrastructure damage, and obviously dead terrorists.\n\nJenin refugee camp by no means meets the definition of neither a camp or refugees. It\'s a city with permanent concrete structures and infrastructure, and the people there are 3rd generation of those who are questionable refugees. Refugee status doesn\'t pass over generations.\n\nA large part of the population in Jenin makes a living by working in israel with a work permit granted to them.\n\nI dont like seeing anyone suffer, especially children, and I\'m sure the vast majority of Israelis have the same sentiment. With that said, the Israeli government has a responsibility to protect its citizens. I do not see this operation as an intentional ""punishment"" to everyone in Jenin and the west bank. I\'m glad there were no innocent civilian casualties. \n\nI think the citizens of the west bank need to start their own revolution and demand leadership that would actually look out for their best interest. Their best interest is NOT fighting forever, costing not only lives but keeping the Palestinians forever in a state of suffering in all aspects. This revolution will have casualties as all revolutions. I personally don\'t know of any country that was ever established in history without going through a revolution, war or another painful and violent event. A state is never handed to you, you need to fight for it, the only problem here is the Palestinians believe they need to fight israel when in fact they need to fight their own leadership. \n\nThere is a clear correlation between IDF operations in the west bank and attacks spawned from there. For several years the west bank has been quiet, many areas there have thrived and prospered. The moment terrorists launch attacks is when the IDF has no choice but to take action.', ""I'm not Jewish or Israeli.\n\nBut it's completely the opposite as far as I can see. The operation in Jenin is extremely targeted.\n\nThere have been virtually no civilian deaths, and the need for this op was very clear given the wave of recent attacks against Israelis.  \n\n\nIf you have a better idea as to how the IDF should handle the issue in Jenin, let me know."", ""I don't have a specific opinion but most of your questions are fairly general. There are militant organizations operating in the camp with widespread popular support.  This Lions' Den organization being the new wild card.   These organizations have launched rockets and conducted attacks outside the camp.  So they do constitute an ongoing threat to life and limb of other persons.  That's the sort of thing a state is obligated to resolve. The PA has indicated it has lost control of Jenin Refugee Camp and is not able to maintain order there.\n\nThis creates 3 possible status for the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp that could apply depending on one's point of view: \n\n1.  They are subjects of Israel.  As such they have an obligation to compliance and in exchange get protections granted by Israel. \n2.  They are citizens of Palestine.  As such they have an obligation to active assist the PA in maintaining the rule of law.  As such they get a say in how to resolve the situation. \n3.  They reside in guerilla held territory as willing subjects if not citizens of whatever government of the Jenin Refugee Camp can plausibly claim the Lion's Den. \n\n(see https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/12o5wod/citizens_vs_subject_obligations/)\n\n(3) makes them responsible for the Lion's Den's actions. Their failure to meet their obligations under (2) is why the IDF was involved at all.  Their failure to meet their obligations under (1) is why Israel is allowed to treat the territory as hostile. \n\nSo we have a situation of one military battling another military with the purpose of subduing it and conquering it.  That's pretty unpleasant to be on the losing side of.  As far as I can tell from the descriptions of the attack the Israelis appeared to mostly be doing things consistent with their military objectives.  They were tearing up roads the Lion's Den had mined, they shot infantry under Lion's Den command... That doesn't sound like anything other than what Israel is supposed to do in this situation. Before anyone comments I'll agree in advance that there probably were soldiers who made poor choices.  But my point is that the overall structure, that is what was decided at a state level, is consistent with Israel's obligations given the situation the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp presented them with.   \n\nIf the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp don't want to face the IDF then they need to come into compliance with Israeli law.   For police to operate successfully they need some level of community support.  The alternative to police is not self rule, it is facing a military.  The definition of a government is the entity that has established a monopoly on final force.  Israel has that monopoly. The Lion's Den challenged that monopoly unsuccessfully.  This isn't a complex issue."", '>civilians likely did die (considering the handful of children who were killed)\n\nIt\'s worth noting that ""children"" (meaning, people below the age of 18) being killed does not mean that civilians were killed, Not every person below the age of 18 is a civilian.\n\nSome of the confirmed militants were 16 and 17; those are the ""dead children"" you hear about.\n\nPalestine uses child soldiers. I wish they didn\'t have to die, but when an armed person poses a threat, they should be killed regardless of their age.\n\nFor example here in the US, where there are many school shootings, the shooters are often children themselves, and they often need to be killed by the police. It is correct for the police to do this. After police successfully stop a school shooting, I don\'t hear people complaining about that.', '*At this pointI am curious about how supporters of Israel continue to support this while claiming defense.*\n\nJenin is a **city** with more than 50.000 residents, density populated. **The camp area was full of militias storing weapons, ammunition, and other devices. T**hey were creating a safe place in the West Bank to launch attacks on Israel. The area was also surrounded by IEDs.  If you don\'t believe it even they showed off their ""power"" in many videos and posts. Considering the magnitude of the Operation it was a big success. The militants were caught by surprise, many weapons were confiscated and the material damage was not so big. Normally we see the same photos of the streets cleared of explosives that give you the sense of ""total destruction"".  Among the 12 Palestinian fatalities (**something that is not to celebrate**) almost all of them were members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n\nSo, considering all I have said the Operation was a great military and political success. Israel has prove that it can act with restraint to preserve its security. Also, there is a **strong message to the PA: If you can\'t control your territory, deal with the consequences.**']"
IsraelPalestine,"Times feature about Jenin youth “wills” elides key facts, context",,06/07/2023 03:19:36,"As the Jenin operations by the IDF wound down after a week’s conflict, the New York Times published [a feature article about teenagers in Jenin joining the fray by throwing rocks or shooting soldiers who hoped to be martyrs - gift link](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/world/middleeast/young-palestinians-west-bank.html?unlocked_article_code=7MNUzAwy9EG6CNReH79g-_MOWUqrYIY7E_H8oJdWMhfQRcipFJ6D6xUt_ud3-cNbWnZqwrbeHFBKsSXwJSaR23fw3Dbl8nip3URKBxQA2ywpnQnPbDemDhzqfAScELhy6oyfAoXab8hGKBuD0VPN3V0TDe76VuYO5w-4EH2rVmJiwQXaxiiEFYTXHwZYzgBpsyyHbYGyLox66juDwq22s6hl4WijwklNkI38pKKPgHGMuL3DXRcDaDV9bH8RzpXqawllZqZWfmGHVp2uT8mDx9_EoLX3K9v2U_l1RSKHOpjUTH7R060bradoZcv3-xgqSflavR7J856IC3G0joBIiijveCm3SQebEP-JX1dW&smid=url-share) and carried “wills” in their pockets.

The “wills” are handwritten suicide notes asking parents not to be sad because their child has achieved glorious martyrdom or fervent wishes that their martyrdom, however insignificant, will achieve millennial dreams of liberation.

Parents, like those described in [my post several months ago about parents in Nablus lamenting their kids joining terror gangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/zpwtga/parents_in_nablus_fret_over_their_children/), aren’t encouraging but seem powerless to stop their kids from following the martyrdom pied piper. 

A teacher is quoted as pleading with his students not to throw away their lives, but he is waved off.  Others are quoted with predictable explanations about the kids being frustrated by the nationalistic political impasse with Palestine, or the daily oppression of checkpoints, or wanting to feel like they are doing important adult things.

So the Times feature explains the phenomenon of Palestinian youth engaging in a lemming like suicide martyrdom by Israeli solider ultimately with the explanation of colonialist oppression that basically makes its hopeless youth commit suicide as a form of widespread protest, like Buddhist monks setting themselves aflame to protest the Vietnam war.

But is that the correct frame for this situation?  The Times analysis totally omits two critical, highly significant facts that anyone who reads this sub for a month will see someone refer to: (1) the battle over UNRWA school curricula and (2) Martyrs Fund and its role in the Palestinian economy.

(1) According to NGO watchdog agencies like IMPACT-SE, Palestinian textbooks and curriculula are highly militant and jihadist and promote violence against Jews and martyrdom from grades 3 - 12. Not only do these materials encourage jihad and delegitimize Israel, but the instructions are hamhandedly worked into arithmetic and physics workbook lessons, subtracting dead soldiers or the calculating the force of a slingshot rock.  

The NGOs, UN and EU who pay for the textbooks have admonished the PA and Hamas to dial back the Israel hate, but since 2014 according to IMPACT-SE it gets steadily worse every year — almost as if the Palestinian powers that be were spitefully ignoring western entreaties for moderation and re-introducing discussions of peace (existence of Israel, Oslo Accords) and pushing back by making childhood instruction even more stridently propagandistic.  

And aside from school instruction, one assumes many if not most of these kids receive indoctrination from parents or Imams about the prejudices and grievances that Muslims have with Jews over Palestine (don’t know much about the religious education angle, or indeed whether boys commonly go to mosques with their fathers etc., but certainly long-standing, never revoked fatwa generally command the faithful to jihad over Palestine and fighting to avenge this cosmic injustice of Palestine and Nakba).

(2) The Martyr’s Fund pays the families of the martyred children and prisoners a stipend which is higher than the prevailing wages or salaries in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank.  It is a serious factor in the Palestinian economy: **about half** of the total amount of revenues received by the PA from international aid.  This policy of the PA is also criticized by Israel and the Palestinians’ western funders.

So, the two biggest discretionary uses of money by the PA are to incentivize martyrdom and to inculcate violent, nihilistic fanaticism and glorification of kamikaze attacks by teenagers.  And parents and teachers in Jenin profess cluelessness to Times reporters, who I’m willing to bet are totally unaware of the two key factors of context I just mentioned which make this inexplicable martyrdom fad make a lot more sense.

If Americans were aware of these two key missing factors, they might better correctly understand the situation in more familiar terms: cult behavior and fanaticism, not the colonialist oppression and despair of the wretched of the earth.

And if they viewed the Jenin youth through this lens, they might too be outraged by the cynicism and evil of the faceless government and religious leaders and bureaucrats who put this poison in the textbooks of eight year olds and divert much of the government’s funds to paying its citizens for killing Jews.","['Between this NYT piece and the BBC anchor accusing Israelis of Happily killing children, it seems there is a concerted effort by western media outlets to normalize Palestinian use of child soldiers.', '10/12 killed were confirmed militants, with another one being buried in a Fatah flag, only one had unclear circumstances.

This is the man videos show Israelis [shooting in the head](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/maureen-clare-murphy/israeli-death-squad-kills-four-jenin) while he lays motionless on the ground.

This is how the death of 17 year old Amjad al-Fayyed is shown to the world: A cold blooded execution by Israeli occupiers, with the sole intention of performing ""ethnic cleansing"" in Palestine. Is it though?

The Al-Quds brigades of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement have announced earlier today that Amjad was a member of the brigades, and was killed in a gunfight with the IDF. Sources:

The sad reality is that the people who have the largest influence on the conflict (the media and the public) only see and share one side of the story. It is very easy to make the IDF look bad because of this whole situation: No one likes a picture of a dead 17 year old, but it's their leadership who leads them in this path and is responsible for their deaths.

It is our responsibility to make sure that the content we spread is not backed by those leaders.

If any of this is wrong I'd like to be corrected but based on this I wouldn't say this specific operation was meant to terrorize Palestinians like you were talking about (even though many other Israeli policies/operations in the West Bank are) or that this should be compared to a mass shooter killing civilians at their place of worship. \n\nIn essence there are a lot of things that are wrong with Israel's administration of the West bank and it's treatment of Palestinians there but this specific operation in question should not be compared to the hate crime in Jerusalem.

IsraelPalestine,"Mythbusting: The Jenin ""Massacre""",,19/11/2020 17:17:44,"Because of their reliance on victimwashing, Palestine and its supporters desperately cling to any deaths they feel were unjustified and caused by Israel so that they can smear Israel as an entity that intentionally kills civilians and commits war crimes (two acts that Palestine does unabashedly). [We discussed the Deir Yassin “massacre” a year or so ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/8nib52/the_myth_of_a_massacre_at_deir_yassin/), and at that time I pointed out that although it was a battle in which a large number of civilians were killed, some intentionally, the pro-Palestine narrative of a town of completely innocent villagers raped and murdered for no reason was false. Today we’re doing to talk about another exaggerated massacre, [Jenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jenin). I thought I was fairly educated on the I/P conflict, but foolish me, I took pro-Palestine folks at their word when they said there was a massacre in Jenin during the Second Intifada. I should have expected that they weren’t telling the truth.
 
Dial your minds back if you will to the early 2000s. The Oslo Accords culminated in a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the vast majority of the West Bank and a deal offered to Yasser Arafat that would create an independent Palestinian state on more than 95% of the West Bank. Instead, Arafat walked away and started the Second Intifada, using suicide bombers as his primary weapon against Israel’s civilian population. Massacre after massacre of Israeli civilians happened. In the months before Jenin, there were three notable attacks:
 
•	June 2001: [The Dophinarium dicotechque massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphinarium_discotheque_massacre). 21 Israelis including 16 teenagers, murdered by a Palestinian suicide bomber on a Tel Aviv beach. In Ramallah dozens of Palestinians celebrated in the streets and fired in the air as a sign of celebration. 

•	March 2002: Haredi Yeshiva ""Beit Yisrael"" in central Jerusalem hosting a bar mitzvah [was bombed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivat_Beit_Yisrael_massacre). 11 Israeli civilians were killed in the attack, including two infants, three children and two teenagers. Again, hundreds of Palestinians celebrated.

•	But finally, in late March 2002 was the [Passover massacre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_massacre) Thirty civilians, including many Holocaust survivors, were killed in the attack and 140 were injured. It was the deadliest attack against Israelis during the entire Second Intifada.
 
All of these attacks, as well as the vast majority of Palestinian terrorism during the Second Intifada, were indisputably war crimes and they indisputably targeted civilians. To those few who might claim that the government didn’t approve of it, maybe you can explain why in 2003 the Palestinian Authority [named a children’s soccer tournament](https://palwatch.org/page/251) after “Shahid Abd Al-Baset Odeh” the suicide bomber who committed the Passover massacre. And while you’re at it, perhaps you can address why [71% of the Palestinians who were polled](https://www.nysun.com/editorials/palestinian-poll/77925/) thought that name was a good choice.
 
Anyway, after the Passover Massacre the Israeli government had finally been pushed too far and Operation Defense Shield began. The purpose of this military operation was for the IDF to go into Palestinian cities to find the terrorists before they strike, not to retaliate or to murder Palestinian civilians the same way so many Israeli civilians had been murdered by Palestine. The Jenin refugee camp was one of the places they went.
 
The IDF used loudspeakers broadcasting their arrival to the people in the city and camp so that they could prepare and get out. This was to avoid as many civilian casualties as they could, but it gave the terrorists an obvious tactical advantage. Thanks to the advanced warning, Palestinian militants hid among civilians and placed ""between 1000 and 2000 bombs and booby traps"" around the town and the refugee camps. One militant said that over 50 civilian homes were booby trapped with high explosives. This is a war crime, not that anybody cares.
 
So the IDF entered and the battle began. And yes, it was a battle, it raged for almost a week. Part of the reason it took so long was because of the IDF’s reluctance to use airstrikes for fear of hitting civilians, instead the IDF used infantry going into the booby trapped region. They could have easily used much more heavy handed methods and got none of their people killed, but as usual they sought to fight more morally than their enemies do and as usual nobody cared.
 
When the smoke cleared and the fighting was over, the casualty numbers were as follows, according to Human Rights Watch: 27 Palestinian militants, 22 Palestinian civilians, and 23 Israeli soldiers killed. Once again, as at Deir Yassin, it’s amazing how peaceful civilian massacre victims were able to kill 23 armed soldiers. And don’t you think it’s interesting that more Israeli soldiers were killed than Palestinian civilians?
 
But of course, the lying began almost before the bodies were cold. These included [Palestinian officials like Saeb Erekat of course](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/palestinians-insist-jenin-was-massacre-despite-un-denial-1.431757), but also the UN and NGOs like Amnesty International who repeated Palestinian claims there there were large numbers of dead civilian bodies under the rubble of Jenin. This of course wasn’t true. [You can read more details on Wikipedia here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jenin#Massacre_allegations) Also, it was only after this battle that groups like the International Solidarity Movement began [shuttling useful idiots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solidarity_Movement#Noteworthy_ISM_events) to the West Bank to “protect” the Palestinians from the Israelis. Apparently the Holocaust survivors in Netanya weren’t worthy of their “protection.”
 
Yassar Arafat for one knew it wasn’t a massacre. He spoke in Jenin afterwards, saying, “People of Jenin, all the citizens of Jenin and the refugee camp, this is Jenin-grad. Your battle has paved the way to the liberation of the occupied territories”. After investigating, even HRW and AI, no friends of Israel, agreed there was no massacre along with the United Nations, Time magazine, and the BBC. The only people saying that it was a massacre are your friendly local Palestine supporters over a decade after the event.
 
To me the Jenin “massacre” is a microcosm of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian leaders manufacture a grievance then commit vicious and inhuman war crimes. The world demands Israel show “restraint” while saying little if anything about Palestine’s behavior. Palestine finally pushes Israel too far, and then when Israel takes steps to stop the mass murder of its people, Palestine lies and plays the boy who cried wolf. The useful idiots in the West repeat their lies about how the Israelis are “massacring civilians.” Thus incentivizing Palestine to do the whole thing all over again. Jenin is just another one in a long series of false narratives created by Palestine to push the victim narrative. I’m sure there’ll be another one soon enough to take its place. Peace.","['\n>Yassar Arafat for one knew it wasn’t a massacre. He spoke in Jenin afterwards, saying, “People of Jenin, all the citizens of Jenin and the refugee camp, this is Jenin-grad.

Hamas found a way to continue receiving international funds while not directly attacking Israel, Forcing Israel to deal with what we call ""Wave of individual terrorists"" so Sinwar keeps pouring oil to the fire, calling to the Shaheeds to do his deeds.  


**Since the beginning of March this year 19 civilians have been brutally murdered by said terrorists and 60 were injured.**

Some attacks were so violent as if they were taken from a movie, In Hadera, two terrorists armed with rifles and bullet proof vest with the ""Punisher"" sign, they opened fire on whatever breathed on their path including point blank on camera murder verification of the female soldier on the ground before grabbing her weapon.

Just a week ago, two terrorists brutally murdered 3 people using axes in the city of Elad they even made their way to the city's children park, one of the victims was killed with an axe to the head in front of his children, other one was actually the one that usually drives them from the border to help them find job inside of Israel.  


Hamas, Islamic Jihad, you name it all of them are usually racing after a terror attack to claim ownership of the terrorists who made it.  


But as later figured out, most of them were either originated in Jenin or sent from Jenin.

For example, CNN reported the massacre, and in the same paragraph wrote "" On Thursday, Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians and wounded several others in the West Bank city of Jenin"".

Palestinians especially in Jenin have begun to protest against the PA saying that they are unable to protect civilians or stop the incursions into their communities.

The IDF’s undermining of the PA is going to backfire as the people look for more “proactive” leadership in these difficult times.

As the death toll rises armed groups gain more soldiers and the Palestinians see the occupation as more and more intolerable.

At this point, the only thing keeping the West Bank from disintegrating into a nasty three-way civil war between the PA and its loyalists, Hamas and other dissident groups, and settler militias is Tzahal, and after a certain point maintaining the facade of non-involvement is no longer worth the costs to Israel's domestic security and the safety of Israeli citizens."", 'It’s really simple - don’t carry out or plot attacks against Israelis, & there will not be any raids in Jenin. \n\nI actually really agree with most of your comment below OP - Palestinians have much more to gain from de-escalation.

The coffin was to be carried to the church by a hearse, this is what her family wanted. Why is no one talking about that? Do we just ignore her family wishes?

I do understand that she was well respected in the Palestinian community, but to forcefully take the coffin so you could walk it yourselves? And basically spitting in the face of her family?

""after a group of them tried to carry her coffin on their shoulders rather than let it be loaded in a hearse.""

IsraelPalestine,Explaining how to calculate the body count,,26/10/2023 09:35:19,"I figured there's a lot of people spending a lot of time trying to work out if eradicating Hamas is worth however many people the ISIS Ministry of Health in Gaza has said have already died.

To that end, I make a scientific contribution, based on known past facts and extrapolations of data.

1. According to the ISIS Ministry of Health, [700 Palestinians died overnight two nights ago](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/more-than-700-killed-in-overnight-israeli-attacks-gaza-officials-say) in 400 Israeli air raids. I have linked to Al Jazeera as it is an ISIS-friendly news source and would never lie.
2. According to the Palestinian Authority represented by one, Ahmed Abdel Rahman who held the post of Secretary-General of the PA, in 2002 Israel killed ""[thousands](https://www.upi.com/Archives/2002/04/12/Palestinians-Thousands-in-mass-graves/5171018584000/)"" in the Battle of Jenin. You will note that the Palestinian Authority would never ever lie about these things.

Obviously the above are authoritative statements and speak to the amazing efficiency of Palestinian leaders, whether ISIS or ISIS-lite, in counting dead Arabs.

In contrast I bring our Western first world nations where a [collapsed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_condominium_collapse) in Surfside, Florida - a single non-bombed building, might I add... it took 4 days to confirm 10 dead. The total number of dead ended up being 98 and the final confirmation came 32 days after the event.

The fact that the ISIS Ministry of Health was able to identify 700 dead Arabs by pulling 700 bodies out of the rubble of collapsed buildings (one presumes 400 such buildings) in a 12hr overnight period speaks to their efficiency, attention to detail and rigorous scientific approach. Very impressive.

You know what makes it even more impressive? They managed to sift through the rubble of (presumably) 400 bombed buildings IN THE DARK overnight, because obviously there's no fuel for the power station or any other equipment to light up the rubble for emergency workers to work in.

Impressive? Nay. Astonishing. The Palestinians and their natural night vision are the next stage of human evolution, clearly.

Now with respect to the Battle of Jenin, where many ""thousands"" (I presume that ""many"" means at least ""two"" of these ""thousands"") were killed, it turns out that the sneaky Jews hid all but 53 of the bodies. This is very important - remember that ISIS and ISIS-Lite would never ever lie or try to elevate the numbers of dead Arabs in the knowledge that there are sycophantic and completely brainless zombies in the West who actually believe them, and not just believe them, but actively deny any questioning of ISIS and ISIS-Lite whose authority on such matters is unparalleled (see points 1 and 2 above).

I call this the ""Jenin Multiplier"" - where only a fortieth of those killed will be found, with the pesky Zionists having stolen all the other bodies.

2 days ago we were at ""over 5000"" dead according to the ISIS Ministry of Health, and Al Jazeera. I presume that today we're at ""over 6000"".

Based on the ""Jenin Multiplier"" of 40x, we will find only 150 dead in Gaza. Of these 150 dead Palestinians, 471 would have been killed by the PIJ rocket attack on Al-Ahli hospital, which holds the all-Middle-East record for number of Arabs killed in one strike. Congratulations to PIJ on that achievement.

In any case, with the above documented and rigorous scientific process, I conclude that the number of dead Palestinians is somewhat north of 150 people and quite a bit south of 6000. All other bodies have been hidden by the Zionists and will never be found.

*However* based on the 150 minimum and the fact that PIJ claims 471 dead of these, it is not impossible that the death toll is currently -321.

Here you go.,,03/02/2023 16:31:11,"So far mainstream media such as BBC and the Guardian have reported things like ""Nine Palestinians killed in Israeli raid in Jenin"" but fail to mention that all of them, (minus 2 who were killed during shootout), were terrorists killed in action.

IsraelPalestine,Why do Palestinian militants hide among civilians?,,07/07/2023 03:17:02,"When Hamas launches rockets into Israel, they often launch from civilian areas. But why don't they launch from the outskirts of Gaza, which is non-populated? It would definitely help to keep their civilians safer. 

Additionally, in the West Bank, terror organizations are based in cities, such as Jenin, as we saw recently. But why can't the militants set up a base somewhere in the desert, and therefore keep the fighting away from civilian areas? Or why can't they at least set up a dedicated building within the city?

To me, the answers to these questions is obvious. The answer is, if Palestinian militants did not hide among civilians, Israel would kill them very quickly and easily. It would be simple to bomb them all. They are safer among civilians because they know that Israel will take precautions to avoid killing civilians.
