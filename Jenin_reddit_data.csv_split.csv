Next to Jenin is the Jenin Refugee Camp, which houses about 10,000 people, who are descendants of displaced Arabs from the 1948 War. 

There are about 300 armed fighters in the RC.  Israel has the identities and arrest warrants for 160 of them— they are who Israel is currently fighting."
0,04/07/2023 06:49:50,">Palestinians claim descendants of descendants are “refugees” no matter where they live and what citizenship they have — the only group to have such a definition. By that logic 

By that logic the Jews have been refugees for 2,000 years and Muslims in the 8th century didn't ask for permission when conquering (butchering Jews as part of some conflict back then) & settling the land"
0,04/07/2023 06:49:50,"Exactly. By that logic, all of Israel should be considered a refugee camp, since there are descendants of refugees from all over the world living there."

You personally never had any conflict with Israel, none. You’re stuck between the hammer and the hard stone, protesting is impossible, now it’s 2AM, you’re father wakes you up, tell you to pack what you can carry because there’s a war you never were part of.

Idgaf about semantics or definition, truly don’t, the lack of people ability to show empathy to the other side disgusts me, and idgaf what’s your bs excuse for that, you will always find one"
0,04/07/2023 06:49:50,">By that logic, everyone is a refugee because their parents, grandparents, or great grandparents were probably from somewhere else.

Not true at all. Refugee status is only passed down from the father not the mother.

So you can have a man born in Kuwait and lives in LA married an American woman of Scott Irish decent and those kids are palestinian refugees. But a woman born in Ramalah who married an Egyptian, kids wouldn't be considered refugees."
0,04/07/2023 06:49:50,Well said - thank you!
0,04/07/2023 06:49:50,"People that had roots and homes in Haifa, Yaffa and other Palestinian cities, were removed from their homes for Israeli cities. Where do you think they went? Some fled to Lebanon (the southern parts where Israeli orchestrated massacres like Sabra and Shatilla took place.) Others fled to Jordan and Egypt. Others fled to other parts like Jenin. 

When an illegal settlement goes up, usually means people were removed before. Where do those people go? 

So some of the people that live in Jenin fled, in 48, some fled in 67, some fled weeks ago when villages were destroyed. 

So ya, after 75 years of taking refugee there, they built basic things like hospitals, roads, and infrastructure. All of which the Israeli military is destroying in recent weeks. 

Lol like come on - the justification of this blood lust by saying: “not a refugee camp” “not civilians but militants” in this SR is appalling and makes complete sense why the Israeli government represents the Israeli people."

Allowing your child to run around the streets during *a war* is gross negligence.

Allowing your child to confront soldiers of an opposing army is gross negligence.

Allowing your child to throw incendiary devices at soldiers of the opposing army during a war is *insanity*.

What the hell is wrong with these Palestinian “parents”?"

This shift in understanding makes me reconsider my initial doubts and recognize the reliability of the organization's reporting.

Can't tell if this is earnest, or a Palestinian propaganda account trying the ol ""I'm unbiased, but I've been convinced that Palestine is right"" shtick. 

The Palestinian Health Administration is by no means an unbiased party in this conflict. Claiming they have no ties to Hamas is just lunacy or willful blindness."
1,30/11/2023 01:46:26,"ABSOLUTELY a MISREPRESENTATION!

If someone engages in a violent conflict with soldiers ANYWHERE in the world, and lights an object to throw,  they have 100% given the soldiers the predicate to shoot them dead.

This is not controversial. It is an absolute basic principle of armed conflict and the laws of use of force.  A lit projectile cannot be carefully assessed during conflict and must be assumed to carry potentially lethal impact thus authorizing lethal force to neutralize. 

Not a single army in the world trains to allow the device to be thrown.  This is irrespective of whether the thrower is a Jew, Muslim, Russian, Chinese citizen, Australian, Arab, 70 year old, 8 year old, male, female, gay, two spirit. It has NOTHING to do with the throwers identity.  It is an act of potentially le5hal force. 

And the ONLY REASON to throw a non lethal incendiary is to create the IMPRESSION that it is a lethal incendiary and provoke lethal forces. In other words, someone decided this child was worth more dead, than alive. 

Shame on their parents, their culture, their blame Israel only instigators, for throwing their own young away in order to create a negative PR hit for Israel. 

It's exactly as Golda Meir said half a century ago:

When peace comes we will perhaps in time be able to forgive the Arabs for killing our sons, but it will be harder for us to forgive them for having forced us to kill their sons. Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children more than they hate us.

1,30/11/2023 01:46:26,"War is hell. What else is there to say? 

Don't engage violently with soldiers in a hot spot while a country is at war, and you won't get shot by said soldiers. It's sad, and I feel bad for the soldiers who had to make that call and for the families impacted by the loss."
1,30/11/2023 01:46:26,"Unfortunately, a shooting kid sent by heartless adults to fight and kill can kill.

We don't know the full situation, but if a soldier sees a child about to through an explosive on him, what should he do? Obviously shoot to disarm not to kill, but in combat it's very hard to do that accurately.

Of course I wouldn't want any of those kids to die, but if they were about to throw explosives the soldiers didn't have another choice"
1,30/11/2023 01:46:26,"Someone posted in another subreddit that the 8yo was standing behind the 12yo, which looked to light and throw something, and was shot by collateral damage. The kids running around were used as diversionary tools, this is all very cynical use of kids and aweful all around."

1,30/11/2023 01:46:26,I really would like to see these condemnations focused on the Palestinian adults that are recruiting children and putting weapons in their hands before sending them out to confront armed soldiers.

2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"First we have to establish what the goal of the operation was: to degrade the capability of the terror organisations in Jenin and ensure more freedom of operation for the IDF there.

Jenin has really become a hotbed for militancy, especially over the last year and a half, with there being a build up of capability in the city and also IED’s and whatnot being a threat which made it hard for the IDF to operate in the area. This operation focused on degrading the capabilities of the groups, which we saw with the destruction of command centres, an explosives laboratory, the seizure of explosive devices and other weapons. We also saw the IDF trying to clear IED’s from the area, which is what we saw them doing to the streets.

You have characterised the operation as some all-encompassing, indiscriminate attack, but every Palestinian killed was claimed as a terrorist by their respective groups. The operations do impact civilians, and that’s a terrible thing, but it’s the terror groups who choose to hide themselves amongst the civilian population, the onus for what happens next is on them"
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"Lots of comments already and you’re doing a great job responding to them all.  I’ll just add my two cents, both from the perspective of an Israel supporter and, probably more importantly, from (non-IDF) military experience.

I think “targeted” in this context means something very different than it would in ordinary English.  Urban warfare in a densely populated place like Jenin is so difficult and dangerous that it is hard to accurately describe in a way that will do it justice.  Any military’s priority is to accomplish the mission with minimum casualties — meaning casualties on your side, not the other side.  Casualties on the other side should be minimized to the extent possible, but not at the risk of endangering our own side.  

So the ordinary military calculus for an operation like Jenin generally leads to one conclusion: aerial bombardment to eliminate targets at maximum distance and with the least risk to your own units.  In other words, flatten the place.  Israel could easily do so, and mission accomplished.

But Israel doesn’t want to do that for lots of political and genuinely held humanitarian reasons.  As a result, Israel fights the Palestinian militant organizations with both hands and one foot tied behind its back.  (To be clear, the US would not do this if it were in Israel’s position.)  Instead of flattening Jenin, the IDF went in with ground units supported by armor and some air support to take out specific targets.  This is an unbelievably risky thing to do, they didn’t have to do it, but it seems to have gone relatively well all things considered.  That there appear to have been only two non-combatant fatalities during the whole operation is nothing short of miraculous, in my opinion.

So anyways, “targeted” is a relative term.  Was it “targeted” in terms of impacting only the people actually responsible for terror attacks in Israel?  Definitely not.  Jenin is trashed and more than 100 people were injured.  But was it “targeted” in terms of killing only the people Israel actually meant to kill?  Overwhelmingly yes, at least in comparison to any of the other strategic options Israel might have chosen."
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"We can't deny that the daily lives of Jenin's residents got affected by the operation. However, when more than 50 attacks launched from Jenin, plus the murder of Israeli civilians which also affected Israel and daily lives of its citizens - no one questioned the actions. No mainstream international media coverage. No criticism by the west (Please correct me if I am wrong). How can the attack not intrusive to Israelis? 

I hope the people who condemned the operation could also give suggestions on ways to do it differently with similar effectiveness. We are talking about an armed group who were pointing guns at them, and hiding weapons, explosives in public places such mosque to be used to kill Israeli civilians. The people who condemn the Israelis actions, their countries would do 10x worser if they face similar attack.

Lives lost are tragic, no matter it's Israeli or Palestinian. We can't talk about being fair when we ignore the attack and killing of Israeli civilians perpetrated by the armed group from Jenin."
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"Harboring terrorists, willfully or not, has consequences. In this case those consequences were property and infrastructure damage, and obviously dead terrorists.

Jenin refugee camp by no means meets the definition of neither a camp or refugees. It's a city with permanent concrete structures and infrastructure, and the people there are 3rd generation of those who are questionable refugees. Refugee status doesn't pass over generations.

A large part of the population in Jenin makes a living by working in israel with a work permit granted to them.

I dont like seeing anyone suffer, especially children, and I'm sure the vast majority of Israelis have the same sentiment. With that said, the Israeli government has a responsibility to protect its citizens. I do not see this operation as an intentional ""punishment"" to everyone in Jenin and the west bank. I'm glad there were no innocent civilian casualties. 

I think the citizens of the west bank need to start their own revolution and demand leadership that would actually look out for their best interest. Their best interest is NOT fighting forever, costing not only lives but keeping the Palestinians forever in a state of suffering in all aspects. This revolution will have casualties as all revolutions. I personally don't know of any country that was ever established in history without going through a revolution, war or another painful and violent event. A state is never handed to you, you need to fight for it, the only problem here is the Palestinians believe they need to fight israel when in fact they need to fight their own leadership. 

There is a clear correlation between IDF operations in the west bank and attacks spawned from there. For several years the west bank has been quiet, many areas there have thrived and prospered. The moment terrorists launch attacks is when the IDF has no choice but to take action."
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"I'm not Jewish or Israeli.

But it's completely the opposite as far as I can see. The operation in Jenin is extremely targeted.

There have been virtually no civilian deaths, and the need for this op was very clear given the wave of recent attacks against Israelis.  


If you have a better idea as to how the IDF should handle the issue in Jenin, let me know."
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"I don't have a specific opinion but most of your questions are fairly general. There are militant organizations operating in the camp with widespread popular support.  This Lions' Den organization being the new wild card.   These organizations have launched rockets and conducted attacks outside the camp.  So they do constitute an ongoing threat to life and limb of other persons.  That's the sort of thing a state is obligated to resolve. The PA has indicated it has lost control of Jenin Refugee Camp and is not able to maintain order there.

This creates 3 possible status for the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp that could apply depending on one's point of view: 

1.  They are subjects of Israel.  As such they have an obligation to compliance and in exchange get protections granted by Israel. 
2.  They are citizens of Palestine.  As such they have an obligation to active assist the PA in maintaining the rule of law.  As such they get a say in how to resolve the situation. 
3.  They reside in guerilla held territory as willing subjects if not citizens of whatever government of the Jenin Refugee Camp can plausibly claim the Lion's Den. 

(see https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/12o5wod/citizens_vs_subject_obligations/)

(3) makes them responsible for the Lion's Den's actions. Their failure to meet their obligations under (2) is why the IDF was involved at all.  Their failure to meet their obligations under (1) is why Israel is allowed to treat the territory as hostile. 

So we have a situation of one military battling another military with the purpose of subduing it and conquering it.  That's pretty unpleasant to be on the losing side of.  As far as I can tell from the descriptions of the attack the Israelis appeared to mostly be doing things consistent with their military objectives.  They were tearing up roads the Lion's Den had mined, they shot infantry under Lion's Den command... That doesn't sound like anything other than what Israel is supposed to do in this situation. Before anyone comments I'll agree in advance that there probably were soldiers who made poor choices.  But my point is that the overall structure, that is what was decided at a state level, is consistent with Israel's obligations given the situation the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp presented them with.   

If the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp don't want to face the IDF then they need to come into compliance with Israeli law.   For police to operate successfully they need some level of community support.  The alternative to police is not self rule, it is facing a military.  The definition of a government is the entity that has established a monopoly on final force.  Israel has that monopoly. The Lion's Den challenged that monopoly unsuccessfully.  This isn't a complex issue."
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,">civilians likely did die (considering the handful of children who were killed)

It's worth noting that ""children"" (meaning, people below the age of 18) being killed does not mean that civilians were killed, Not every person below the age of 18 is a civilian.

Some of the confirmed militants were 16 and 17; those are the ""dead children"" you hear about.

Palestine uses child soldiers. I wish they didn't have to die, but when an armed person poses a threat, they should be killed regardless of their age.

For example here in the US, where there are many school shootings, the shooters are often children themselves, and they often need to be killed by the police. It is correct for the police to do this. After police successfully stop a school shooting, I don't hear people complaining about that."
2,08/07/2023 14:02:44,"*At this pointI am curious about how supporters of Israel continue to support this while claiming defense.*

Jenin is a **city** with more than 50.000 residents, density populated. **The camp area was full of militias storing weapons, ammunition, and other devices. T**hey were creating a safe place in the West Bank to launch attacks on Israel. The area was also surrounded by IEDs.  If you don't believe it even they showed off their ""power"" in many videos and posts. Considering the magnitude of the Operation it was a big success. The militants were caught by surprise, many weapons were confiscated and the material damage was not so big. Normally we see the same photos of the streets cleared of explosives that give you the sense of ""total destruction"".  Among the 12 Palestinian fatalities (**something that is not to celebrate**) almost all of them were members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

So, considering all I have said the Operation was a great military and political success. Israel has prove that it can act with restraint to preserve its security. Also, there is a **strong message to the PA: If you can't control your territory, deal with the consequences.**"
3,06/07/2023 03:19:36,"Between this NYT piece and the BBC anchor accusing Israelis of Happily killing children, it seems there is a concerted effort by western media outlets to normalize Palestinian use of child soldiers."

Both of these factors are irrelevant. Mostly because Palestinians, including Palestinian youth have been fighting against the IDF and Zionists (and often dying) well prior to the Martyr's fund becoming a thing, before the UNRWA school curriculum was established and before any possible actual impact from UNRWA after a certain period of time could have happened. I've yet to read the article but from the way you framed it NYT seems more-or-less correct here."

Like they offered free bullets to anyone who wanted to be an active shooter.  Or the NRA Legal Defense Fund would defend in his death penalty case any accused mass killer who survived, because the rights of the public to free access to firearms was more important than occasional harms and inconvenience from mass shootings.  Or that the mass shootings were praised by the President because they were the last thing standing between patriots and antifa.

And then someone writes an article about “why are youth committing kamikaze attacks” and doesn’t make reference to the official promulgation of these values and incentives by schools and government.  

So you say Arabs have been killing Jews and vice versa in Palestine for 100 years at least nothing to see here.

The Times would certainly write about this official indoctrination and not the typical colonialist pap if they were writing about, say, Iran or North Korea and not the precious, innocent Palestinians."
3,06/07/2023 03:19:36,If both the martyrs fund and school curriculum are irrelevant that means it's a cultural issue. Lots of people try to excuse the use of child soldiers by shifting the blame to Israel but ignore that there are plenty of other conflicts in which this doesn't happen. As such it's safe to say that Palestinians sending their children to die is something they themselves celebrate and encourage rather than an act that is forced upon them.
4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"Original post for anyone who still want to discuss the issue

 

>I did some research and concluded that the two men Israel targeted and killed in Jenin were not high-ranking members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) or Hamas. The man claimed by PIJ were 28-year-old Nidal Khazem. This is the man videos show Israelis [shooting in the head](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/maureen-clare-murphy/israeli-death-squad-kills-four-jenin) while he lays motionless on the ground. Nidal lived in Jenin, was single, studied mechatronics in university, and loved motorbikes.  
>  
>Nidal frequently posted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100088503610866) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nidal.khazem/) and did not keep a low profile. He even appeared on [national news last year](https://twitter.com/qudsn/status/1575583893981372418). He also loved posing with guns and published dozens of photos of him doing that. According to Zionists, [this is evidence of him being a terrorist](https://twitter.com/TheMossadIL/status/1636479589600964613). [Montages featuring Nidal](https://twitter.com/Anas_A_Aljamal/status/1636382592751763458) published by the PIJ all use photos from his open Facebook profile.  
>  
>So let's think. This 28-year-old is apparently a ""senior commander"" in PIJ but dumb enough to pose with weapons and not cover his identity. Wouldn't it be smarter for a high-ranking PIJ militant to keep a low profile rather than to speak to the media at every opportunity? Wouldn't someone like Nidal be a huge liability to an actual underground militia?

>Why would the PIJ state that he was a senior member? As a courtesy to the grieving family. Better for them to hear that he was someone rather than just an unlucky guy posing with guns. And why would Shin Bet state assassinate two Palestinians who were not ""senior"" in any way shape or form? Because the blood-thirsty Israeli public demands revenge? Because some gung-ho Israeli men really really wanted to pretend they were Rambo? Maybe both? We don't know."
4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"Dude… respectfully… you make it really clear in this post that you’re not well-versed in this stuff. “Wouldn’t it be smarter… he’s too young…” that’s not how any of this works. You really think you can look at someone in the PIJ and go “well I wouldn’t have done that so he wouldn’t do that either!!!” Like, stop. It’s okay. It’s okay to not know stuff but be honest with yourself about what you don’t know."
4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"So basically Israel’s security forces and PIJ conspired to give cover for Israel’s killing of a random Palestinian dude (while risking lives of its soldiers) for no good reason whatsoever.

4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"Okay but listen I have an equally good theory, really just paraphrasing you mostly:

Jews are space lizards 🦎 blood thirsty and all, pretending to be Rambo. Palestinians never mean what they say or say what they mean because they haven’t fallen down the rabbit hole yet (Alice in wonderland reference, just keep going), so we must ascribe the best of intentions to them and the worst to Jews because, you know, JEWS. 
Right? 

/s but sadly also not"
4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"So...your theory is that this particular random Palestinian 'bystander' out of the dozens of bystander casualties in a given year was randomly selected by PIJ to be posthumously 'honored' as a commander--a strange sort of 'honor' to undoubtedly bring suspicion and surveillance on all his family and friends for years to follow--and that a bunch of psychotically bloodthirsty Israelis decided that the easiest way to get their jollies killing Palestinians would be to undertake an insanely dangerous undercover Musta'arabi mission into the heart of one of the most hostile cities in the West Bank? 

And your evidence for this conspiracy theory that, even if Israelis were the Jack the Rippers you fantasize about them being, would require a dozen different people to be taking strong shots of idiot juice is that the 'militant leader' took the wholly unprecedented act of building a public persona among the people he purports to be fighting for?"

4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"Why does the age mean that he can’t be a senior commander? 

I know that in many militaries, a 28 year old can’t be very high up, since there is a formal system for moving through ranks, and there is a minimum amount of time to spend at each rank. But the system is probably less formal for terrorists. Also if they join as teenagers, they have more time in the organization. 

And yes it’s stupid to pose with weapons. A smart person would indeed keep a low profile. But these terrorists aren’t known for being the most intelligent people."
4,18/03/2023 00:32:14,"Outside of pure speculation based on a desire to exonerate Khazem and demonise Israel, let’s focus on what we know:

1) Khazem regularly posed with weapons.

2) A highly specialised ISF unit conducted a high risk mission in the middle of Jenin in order to assassinate him. 

3) Shin Bet claimed he was involved in “significant terrorist activity”.

4) PIJ lionised him, calling him a field commander in their Jenin Brigade.

In order for your theory to be true, we must accept the following: 

1) PIJ lied about their claiming of Khazem as a member.

2) Shin Bet lied about their intelligence assessment.

3) Israel authorised a high risk mission involving specialist underover operators to assassinate someone on the basis that they had some guns on Facebook.


On a preponderance of the evidence, it is not likely that the necessary assumptions required for your theory to be true. You would need to establish that:

- Shin Bet deliberately publishes false intelligence assessments.

- PIJ claims people as members (in this case senior member) without it being the case.

- Israel greenlights these operations based on essentially nothing.

None of this has been established here."
4,18/03/2023 00:32:14," Nidal Khazem. is the cousin of Raed Khazem.  Raed Khazem killed 2 or 3 (depending on how you count) Israelis in Tel Aviv and escaped. When he was killed in April it was known there were family connections. Abdelrahman Khazem, Raed's brother has also been killed.

> If not, why do you think they entered Jenin at all?

As far as I understand it the IDF entered the refugee camp in the first place to raid a PIJ cell operating out of there, I've seen some people say that there's 'video evidence' of this, so if someone has that (or any other form of evidence that I couldn't find) and could link it that would be great. 

I didn't look into the clashes in detail at all but I seriously doubt the IDF just waltzed in there to kill Palestinians for no reason and leave, there seems to have been an actual military target there and the Palestinians in the camp attempting to secure it were armed and were firing which eventually lead to at least one civilian getting killed in the crossfire. If any of this is wrong I'd like to be corrected but based on this I wouldn't say this specific operation was meant to terrorize Palestinians like you were talking about (even though many other Israeli policies/operations in the West Bank are) or that this should be compared to a mass shooter killing civilians at their place of worship. 

In essence there are a lot of things that are wrong with Israel's administration of the West bank and it's treatment of Palestinians there but this specific operation in question should not be compared to the hate crime in Jerusalem. They're certainly connected but not on the same level or equivalent at all really. Largely because one included the deliberate targeting of civilians and the other (as far as I can tell) did not."

6,28/01/2023 16:54:34,"The IDF (and other law enforcement) goes into Jenin for the same reason they have mounted these counter-insurgency operations since the days the doctrine was first set out by Orde Wingate’s supernumerary police during the Arab Revolt and later Palmach/IDF paratrooper doctrine to go behind enemy lines so to speak and try to eliminate terror cells and their threat before they can deploy, based on good intelligence, mostly humint double agents and spies.

Under international law the ""assassination missions"" as you call them that take place on occupier land are illegal. It's no different than what western powers have done all over the middle east. Acting as judge jury and executionary in territories outside their legal bounds. I don't think Israel or any nation state or group of people should hold that much power over other people or their own. While they do tho it should be held to the highest level of scrutiny. That's obviously not to say the attack on a synagogue is also illegal and morally atrocious and I don't support that. Resistance acceptable through the framework of international law is another story."

From Vox: ""Israel said the site of the raid housed a terrorist cell of the Islamic Jihad group.""

So, it was a routine raid ending in 10 dead and 20 wounded. 

I'd be remiss without pointing out...

""More than one Palestinian has been killed a day on average in the [**first month**](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/26/why-israeli-raids-killed-many-palestinians-this-year-explainer) of 2023, on track to double the tragic rate of lethal violence in the occupied West Bank last year — which was already the [**highest on record**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/29/palestinians-killed-west-bank-israel/) since the United Nations began collecting this data, and double that of 2021.""

So if perhaps this specific raid was self defense on Israel's part, are we sure the rest of Israel's actions are? I'm pretty certain these actions are what's driving people to terror actions."

I'm not saying armed response is never right, but when your armed response leads to counter armed response and a deadly cycle ensues, the result is the opposite of the declared reason for armed response - to stop violence. The IDF and the spokes people will always say that they acted on intelligence, sopped a ticking bomb and killed terrorists. Whether you believe them or not depends a lot on your orientation towards the Israeli Arab conflict."

It creates a near-impossible situation the Israelis are forced to address (how do you defend against a sucker punch? It’s called a sucker punch for a reason), and detain/arrest operations make sense, assuming those arrested were sought with probable cause and get a fair trial in which they are represented by someone who has access to the evidence. 

The difficulty is, they are viable military targets operating in unbelievably hostile territory, many times in broad daylight. Part of their risk calculus is, it could be necessary, for the lives of the operations team members, to use lethal force against people who don’t pose an immediate active threat to their lives, but who could still get them killed. 

(Example of what I mean: I believe an Israeli sniper was watching the intersection where Abu Aqleh was killed, because had a crowd gathered there and blocked the intersection with vehicles, the Israelis’ only available exit point becomes sealed off, and then they’re sitting ducks in a deadly position where even more lives are lost. I also believe it’s possible that the decision to fire was made so quickly that it wasn’t apparent to him that it was a journalist on the other end until it was too late.)

1. When Israel arrests Palestinians, it is often to hold them indefinitely without trial, torture them to obtain information, and leave them in degrading conditions. Given this (and I don't think this is really disputed), are the Jenin gunmen wrong to prevent the IDF from arresting their brothers?

2. The terroristic activity in Jenin is not terrorism, but resistance, and Israel cannot occupy and then not be to blame for the natural resistance the occupy creates.

They think everything can be worked out through words after a ceasefire.

This is a policy chosen by Israel. They were not forced to do this, indeed it would probably be a better strategy not to engage in this kind of collective punishment. But that would not please right wing jewish Israeli voters, so the government does this. 

So no, this is in Israel's hands. The terrorist attacks can certainly be blamed on the terrorists. But the blame for the oppressive reaction of the Israeli government rests **solely on the ministers themselves**. 

To say otherwise is highly dangerous, it allows a government to justify almost any policy that violates basic rights on the basis of ""blame it on the terrorists"". This is how the US justified the use of torture post 9-11. 

If the Bennet government started putting Palestinians in Jenin in internment camps, or stepping up its torture and detainment without trial policies (I almost typed ""started detaining people without trial"" then remembered Israel does this already...), or just demolished all of Jenin would you still say ""oh Israel isn't responsible, blame the Palestinians!"" ?"

This is one of the more interesting events in the 2nd Intifada as it started with a successful strategy by Islamic Jihad.  The result of the success in initially defending the camp was to transform the operation from less of a policing operation to more of a military operation.  For territory to be occupied it must be under the control of the hostile military, once Jenin was able to resist successfully it was no longer occupied but an area of active military hostilities.

Nothing good happened in 2002 to Jenin.  The destruction was much worse than it otherwise would have been.  The death toll much higher than it otherwise would have been.  They managed to kill 23 Israeli soldiers in exchange for enduring a rather major trauma. 

Jenin didn't have as long to setup as they did in 2002.  But having experienced that setting up 1100 IEDs didn't stop the Israelis, but rather forced them to be much more aggressive possibly changed the dynamic.  Military resistance is pointless."

They were monitoring these guys, created a raid, and surprised them.  They also probably had cooperation from the PA, who hates the fanatics as much as Israel does because they threaten Fatah.  Cooperation has improved with the new government, which is interested in strengthening the PA rather than undermining it.  Open lines of communication kept things calm-ish in the West Bank.

 [""So far, the IAF has dropped about 6,000 bombs against Hamas targets""](https://twitter.com/IAFsite/status/1712484101763342772) (12^(th) October)

If you're leaning towards the \[-321, 150\] range, you're likely wrong. Similarly, the 7,000 figure is likely wrong.

If the destruction of each structure resulted in the death of, on average, 1 civilian, we're looking at about 1000 casualties (Though this is destruction circa 15^(th) October). If it's 10 per structure, we'd be looking at 10,000 casualties - but HAMAS would be saying 10,000 if they thought that was a reasonable estimate, so I don't think it's that high. 

If each Israel bomb resulted in an average 0.5 civilian casualties, we're looking at around 3,000 casualties (circa 2 weeks ago).

I'd put my prediction in the range \[1000, 7000\], with an expected value of around 4000."

Israel bombs 400 buildings, let's say half of those collapsed because averages right.

So 200 buildings 98 per building dead

That's 200 X 98 = 19,600 people potentially dead.
