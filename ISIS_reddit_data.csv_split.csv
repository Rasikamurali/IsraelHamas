0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"No videos of Israelis launching rockets at Gaza shouting ""god is great!"" while women and children die. Keep in mind, one side goes through great lengths to protect their women and children through the Iron Dome from wanton aggression. The other side hides their combatants behind their women and children, and that tells you almost everything you need to know."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,That's why we all feel like we are taking crazy pills! The goal of Hamas is to massacre Jews not establish a thriving Palestine state! Hamas and Hezbollah serve the interest of Iran.
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,Yes! That‚Äôs what people are forgetting because I grew up in the 80s where it was very very common for hamas To kidnap American citizens off the street in Beirut Lebanon. People have forgotten that.

I think Rabin got it right...

>""Until 1967, Israel did not hold an inch of the Sinai Peninsula and the West Bank, the Gaza Strip or the Golan Heights. Israel held not an acre of what is now considered disputed territory. And yet we enjoyed no peace.  
Year after year Israel called for pleaded for ‚Äî a negotiated peace with the Arab governments. Their answer was a blank refusal and more war... The reason was not a conflict over territorial claims. The reason was, and remains, the fact that a free Jewish state sits on territory at all.""

0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"I think it goes without saying that Hamas and Palestine are not the same thing. however, my understanding is Hamas was the ‚Äúelected‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know the circumstances of how that happened) government of Palestine and for the most part, no one speaks out against them. 
That all being said, I don‚Äôt see how anyone comes away from what just occurred in Gaza as a success or anything to be cheered, it‚Äôs one thing to ‚Äúfight the power‚Äù and be the rebels to the western empire, it‚Äôs another to target fully civilian populations and murder indiscriminately (thinking mainly about the music festival). It doesn‚Äôt help that some groups immediately jumped to ‚ÄúIsrael started it‚Äù rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don‚Äôt understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. 
I sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas‚Äô shoulders. I just wish I saw more Palestinian voices speaking out and decrying what took place/ condemning Hamas. Entirely possible I just haven‚Äôt seen those voices. 

Full Disclosure: this is my raw opinion on the matter, only got up to speed today on everything going on. I‚Äôm not saying this is 100% correct so if you have anything to add or correct, please feel free."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"regardless of who you ""support,"" the terrorists have committed heinous acts. If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn't listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"The Palestinian supporters on my social media are saying ‚ÄúIsraelis don‚Äôt care about their hostages because they are bombing Gaza (with a Hamas fighter here or there). Israel just wants destruction.‚Äù I was flabbergasted when I read that. First by saying so casually a Hamas fighter here or there bc Hamas actually did bomb a Gaza hospital so that‚Äôs their justification. And second, I promise as a non Palestinian Muslim woman posting that, if you were there in the country you would NOT be spared by Hamas even if you shared their religion. The supporters are protesting while going back to their comfy homes in the States not even comprehending that if Hamas was in the States, even if you supported their country for ‚Äúresisting against oppression‚Äù, they would literally not spare you."

I don't think being pro-Palestinian means supporting Hamas at all. I can acknowledge all the above and be very uncomfortable with the IDF (these are civilian migrants workers: [https://twitter.com/RamAbdu/status/1719300349792592168](https://twitter.com/RamAbdu/status/1719300349792592168) // [https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-soldiers-film-themselves-abusing-humiliating-west-bank-palestinians/amp/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-soldiers-film-themselves-abusing-humiliating-west-bank-palestinians/amp/)) OR the current Israeli government running this offensive ([https://www.972mag.com/intelligence-ministry-gaza-population-transfer/](https://www.972mag.com/intelligence-ministry-gaza-population-transfer/)) OR the inappropriate calls for Eretz Israel now ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Panarab/comments/17msdts/israels\_official\_account\_in\_arabic\_shows\_entirety/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Panarab/comments/17msdts/israels_official_account_in_arabic_shows_entirety/))

I can think killing 3000 dead children in Gaza won't lead to anything good, nor bring back any other dead children or victims.

I want you to know you're not and never will be my mortal enemy. And especially if you're in Israel now, I hope you and your family and friends are safe and healthy and continue to be so <3"

3,25/11/2023 12:14:02,"I am saying this as someone who was born in Palestine, grew up in both Palestine and Jordan, a Muslim who studied in a Christian school, lived and worked in the US and Europe for more than 5 years collectively.

First of all, I firmly believe that all ethnicities, religions, movements, nations, you name it. The majority (> 95%) of the people who belong to it, are just normal people who are just trying to move through life by getting the sense of belonging to something, a compass for their actions, and a community. While the rest are extremists who are ruining it for everyone because usually they are the loudest.

For the Palestinian woman dancing, there is on the opposite side Israelis grabbing popcorn and watching Israel bombing Gaza. For the Palestinians dancing on October 7th, some Israelis were making tiktoks and reels mocking Gazans who do not have water or electricity. There are bad apples on all sides.

Also, all people are impulsive and dont take the whole context when they are reacting to something. A funny example I can think of, at the start of Covid, it was reported that in NY, Uber drivers were rejecting the requests of Asian people haha. 

The US is a great great country IMO, I think it has a very good influence on the world in general. But, during this process, they have made many lives miserable as well, and they will for sure gain so many haters, and rightfully so tbh. They have staged coups all over the world, started or participated in so many wars.

Death is not celebrated in the Islamic concept at all, and the life of humans is sacred as in any other religion, they just have a different perspective of dying in pursuit of defending your country, or in war. The same in the US, almost every event I attended, there was some kind of appreciation or celebration to the veterans, do the US people worship wars? No, they just have a great perspective of someone risking and dedicating their lives for their country and people, and I am not American, but I got goosebumps every time I saw this. Everything goes both ways in so many beliefs and cultures.

Now, the 9/11 attacks are horrible, by all means. And there is no way on earth that you could justify or defend that. But for the Palestinian woman, who most probably did not think through when she danced, for her the US is part of why Israel has been able to build settlements in the West bank (it is not important for her if it is legal or not), she might have been kicked out of her home because of that, she knows a lot of people who were killed because of that or the whole conflict. She was happy when the US was harmed.

If you ask an Iraqi mother now about the US, who might have lost her children in the war, she might be happy if an earthquake occurred in the US.

Some US citizens were celebrating the Trump Muslim ban, a lot of US citizens in the 40's and 50's said the Nuclear bombs were a very good idea, because they have lost relatives and friends in pearl harbor.

We are really really complicated humans, most of us want to just live in peace, and have a decent life, and we are also weak, so when who we thought are our enemies get attacked, we get the sense that we got a little bit of a revenge, someone got the revenge of my dead son, my dead friend. But I sincerely think that the majority of the world are just good people."
3,25/11/2023 12:14:02,"Quote from Hamas' leader: ""Revolutionary spirit needs women, children and elderlies' blood!""

Yes, sitting in Qatar's five-star hotel Jacuzzi and making speech about suicidal charge is hard burden of leadership...

And American liberals and woke virus infected individuals, don't you ever forget that Palestinians had big party over 9/11 attack."
3,25/11/2023 12:14:02,This is their ideology. This is radical Islamist brainwashing of a population. This is why peace has not been made and cannot be made.
3,25/11/2023 12:14:02,"Morality is a grey area. Talk about the value of life, you mention 911, have you forgotten about the Iraq invasion in the aftermath? You want to talk about inhumane behavior, have you forgotten Iraq Abu Ghraib prison abuse? Here's another case, when we pulled out of Afghanistan there was an incident by a terrorist that resulted in American casualty, in response we drone strike an aid worker that resulted in death of him and his family. You know what we did in the aftermath? We said it was a mistake and apologize wow."

3,25/11/2023 12:14:02,"
Since the attacks undertaken by radical Palestinian extremists on October the 7th in Israel we have seen an unfolding struggle within Western Civilisation and its spheres. A call for ""intifada""¬† chanted by hundreds of thousands of what much of the media terms 'protestors' has in many ways come about. That call, for an intifada, or ""uprising"" to happen within Palestinian terroitories and against Israel has in actuality brought about a parallel process here in western states. An intifada of sorts has metasticised within liberal western capitals, and in many ways thats the point. 



In no other place outside of the Western orbit exists dissident populations of such opposing cultural and political view, indeed not only do they not exist but they could not exist. It is inconceivable that in Tehran there could be a population of up to 40% of white westerners and other non Iranians who week after week clogged the streets to call for uprising against for example Bashar Al-Assads barrel bombing of his own people. There would be mass murder and detention, there would have been ethnic cleansing prior to that even, or before any of these potential eventualities there would have been a crack down on immigration in the first place. To bring this hypothetical parallel potential to its full conclusion, there would in the first place never have been ANY migration into Iran or any other non western illiberal state in the first place. Why? Well because Western nations with western values and western technology producing western oppertunity and western refuge are what migrants seek. 



¬†This is a trap the West broadly finds itself in. Large populations which do not support its interests enabled by those same interests to be where they are in the first place. Put simply, liberal western values and the successes¬† which that has created(hijacked by cultural Marxism) has incubated the conditions into which outside populations enter who in many cases oppose those exact values which facilitated their entry in the first place. 



We then see harrasment of Jewish citizens of France, Britain and other European countries by a strange mix of Marxists and Islamists. Those calls for intifada are not just a call for some struggle in a far off place, but actually an unconscious call for a usurpation in Western countries by those of cultural Marxist bent, in collution with immigrant populations and their descendants who rather than appreciate or value the West which nurtures them, hate and revile it.

Israel is surrounded by enemies - NaziHamas in Gaza at the south, PLO at the west, Hizbollah in Lebanon and Iranian forces in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.
Except for the PLO, all those forces are controlled by Iran.
If Israel will show weakness (as it was over the last 20 years), that would be an invite for all those enemies to attack.
The war on Gaza will be a military campaign after which, all the other enemies of Israel wouldn't dare to consider a similar attack in the future.
This is not an option for Israel, and it is a question of survival.
In fact, for the last 20 years, Israel avoid taking this action because it believed that eventually, NaziHamas will step up to its responsibilities for the civilians in Gaza, and would develop the Gaza strip.

Everyone knows ISIS bad, many are more uncertain with Hamas - if the message that Hamas is the same thing as ISIS then it would be a large boost to Israels support

The boots on the ground and localised attacks aren‚Äôt really the point - Israel wants people to conflate Hamas to an organisation that is unambiguously evil to justify their destruction in a bid to win favour

Hamas is definitely evil, but this way the west has a ""scale"" to compare it to.   
Just like how it was compared to 9/11. Which is actually more on the line of 20 times worse than 9/11, but people need to compare to understand the magnitude of the attack.

11,03/12/2023 18:30:06,"On October 7, thousands of terrorists - mostly Hamas, some from other groups, invaded Israel.  They were followed by thousands of Gazan civilians, who participated in the rapes, torture, murders, and kidnappings that followed.

Last month, last month by Birzeit University‚Äôs Arab World for Research & Development (AWRAD) polled Gazans to see their support for the October 7 attacks.  [76% said they ""strongly"" or ""to some extent"" supported the attacks.](https://www.awrad.org/files/server/polls/polls2023/Public%20Opinion%20Poll%20-%20Gaza%20War%202023.pdf)

Robert Heinlein was an American science fiction author who wrote many books, and many of those include social commentary.  One of those was *Starship Troopers* (ignore the film which is a badly done, completely different story, read the book).

At one point in the book, while the main character is still in military training, a deserter is recovered by his unit, after having kidnapped and murdered a young girl.

The man is promptly sent to the gallows and hung, publicly - and the main character in the book then muses on the situation a bit.  As regards what should be done with Hamas and those individuals who participated in the October 7 attacks, I don't think I can put it better:

> That night I tried to figure out how such things could be kept from happening. 

...

> I suppose he was one of those pathological personalities you read about ‚Äî no way to spot them.

> Well, if there was no way to keep it from happening once, there was only one sure way to keep it from happening twice. Which we had used.

> If Dillinger had understood what he was doing (which seemed incredible) then he got what was coming to him... except that it seemed a shame that he hadn‚Äôt suffered as much as had little Barbara Anne ‚Äî he practically hadn‚Äôt suffered at all.

> But suppose, as seemed more likely, that he was so crazy that he had never been aware that he was
doing anything wrong? What then?

> Well, we shoot mad dogs, don‚Äôt we?

> Yes, but being crazy that way is a sickness ‚Äî 

> I couldn‚Äôt see but two possibilities. Either he couldn‚Äôt be made well ‚Äî in which case he was better dead for his own sake and for the safety of others ‚Äî or he could be treated and made sane. In which case (it seemed to me) if he ever became sane enough for civilized society... and thought over what he had done while he was ""sick"" ‚Äî what could be left for him but suicide? How could he live with himself?

> And suppose he escaped *before* he was cured and did the same thing *again*? And maybe again? How do you explain *that* to bereaved parents? In view of his record?

> I couldn‚Äôt see but one answer."

Because Israel/ IDF PR campaign is not doing a good job at communicating to the international world and combating fake news/ disinformation/ misinformation or information war. 

Raqqa and Mosul bombing were back in 2017.  Tiktok wasn‚Äôt around. People were not seeing live bombing, devastation, human suffering and lost of lives especially children from their social media. 

It says here that Amnesty International revealed more than 1,600 casualties in Raqqa but US led coalition only admitted to killing 159 civilians.

Israel does not have a coalition. Israel went in solo. In the case of Raqqa, you will have multiple news sources collaborating and confirming that BBC will report that the UK military said the death toll is only 159 civilians, France24 will report what the French military said is the death toll is only 159 civilians and CNN, Bloomberg, Fox, etc‚Ä¶ will all report that the Pentagon confirmed death toll of 159 civilians‚Ä¶ there is an entire choir reporting 159 civilian casualties, reinforcing that these are precision strikes targeting military targets only, while Israel is just a one man choir, not very convincing, not very good at communicating and not even trying to win the public opinion war on the international stage."

To be clear, Israeli citizens doesn't mean they identify as Israeli. These are guaranteed to be people who don't support Israel. They were clear they wanted to murder Muslim children in Nazereth and Jews alike. 

The reality is that the pages that pretend to care about Palestinians won't ever post this story, even if they manage to spin the focus to the Israeli citizenship aspect. Palestine support doesn't extend to Shin Bet stopping a mass shooting of children."

Said attack would result in Palestinian groups fighting against each other instead of blaming Israel who were the ""real"" perpetrators of the attack. OP seems to also claim that Benny Gantz found out about the plot before it could be carried out which is why they were arrested and that the Mossad is acting without government oversight to escalate the conflict further.

Basically, this is actually all Israel's fault and it wasn't a simple case of Palestinians who joined ISIS to kill Jews and Arabs they thought to be ""infidels"".

There also seems to be another theory in that the Mossad knew about the ISIS cell and did nothing to stop it because the target was Palestinian schoolchildren (since Israelis love it when Palestinian children get killed apparently). The only reason the cell got arrested was because they added Jewish targets to their hit list and had to be apprehended before the Jews were killed instead.

I hope I managed to sum this up nicely for anyone else who was confused."
12,02/10/2022 17:36:06,"They sure took their time catching these terrorists!

2. Israel is used to dealing with terrorism, is thus more secure."
14,18/05/2021 10:56:22,"Because at the time they held power they did not want to open up an additional front potentially, while fighting in Iraq, Kurdish areas, Syria, threats to Jordan, Egypt and more simaltainously. Thats alot of areas to fight in, supply and support.

That and unlike some on said list. They had a fully rested and professional first world military capability and the approaches included other nations, whom already enaged with and or the well planned and fairly defensive line of thr Golan heights.

The sini they where already clashing with Egyptian forces and plus its open desert for hundreds of miles. Qny attack forces would be seen miles off and end up in a unwinnable stand up battle vs a professional force, operating close to own supply lines, air bases and defending against an enemy force whom know offered no qauter. 

Jordan had time to prepare, and had a western trained and equiped army. Youd have to go through Jordan, and Israel would out of interest likely assist them.

16,26/10/2023 09:35:19,"[According to satellite imagery analysis, UNOSAT identified 927 destroyed structure, 1216 severely damaged structures and 3121 moderately damaged structures, for a total of 5264 buildings. This corresponds to around 15% of the total structures in the North Gaza Governorate.](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/unosat-north-gaza-governorate-damage-assessment-analysis-15-october-2023) (15th October, UNOSAT)

 [""So far, the IAF has dropped about 6,000 bombs against Hamas targets""](https://twitter.com/IAFsite/status/1712484101763342772) (12^(th) October)

If you're leaning towards the \[-321, 150\] range, you're likely wrong. Similarly, the 7,000 figure is likely wrong.

If the destruction of each structure resulted in the death of, on average, 1 civilian, we're looking at about 1000 casualties (Though this is destruction circa 15^(th) October). If it's 10 per structure, we'd be looking at 10,000 casualties - but HAMAS would be saying 10,000 if they thought that was a reasonable estimate, so I don't think it's that high. 

If each Israel bomb resulted in an average 0.5 civilian casualties, we're looking at around 3,000 casualties (circa 2 weeks ago).

I'd put my prediction in the range \[1000, 7000\], with an expected value of around 4000."

These institutions also give an estimate (since it is impossible to know the exact number of victims, as searches in the rubble are reduced due to the lack of gasoline), so it is possible to compare the data."
16,26/10/2023 09:35:19,"So let's do some maths.

A SINGLE building collapsed in Florida

>The total number of dead ended up being 98

Israel bombs 400 buildings, let's say half of those collapsed because averages right.

So 200 buildings 98 per building dead

That's 200 X 98 = 19,600 people potentially dead.

I think Hamas is being conservative with the numbers tbh.

700 doesn't seem so farfetched to me considering the Palestinians have nowhere to go but take cover in buildings."

I've literally been pushed to the middle now because I can't take how many idiot leftists have fallen for terrorism, just so that they can get behind another cause and pretend to be woke.

My take on it. I think that after 9/11, our society became extremely racist towards Muslims and after several years, the Islamophobia movement came about, which was great because it did really combat racism towards Muslims. However, we've now gone so far in that direction as a society, we're no longer critically analyzing situations. We're now just saying let's not be Islamophobic so Israel must be bad because they're all white. Of course everyone is forgetting the sheer fact that Jews have never been classified as white, and white supremacists absolutely hate the Jews and are currently rejoicing in this bloodbath.

Absolutely ridiculous and now somehow I'm a centrist because I don't support terrorism. What a joke."

I'm not leftist by definition but I do agree with many leftist claims and theories. Hamas is a little bit too far for me and I can't understand why I'm disagreeing with the leftists.

Yes Israel has made mistakes over the past 50 years, same as Palestinians. 

But no matter what, Hamas can't be the right answer to any question. Starting from a position that our enemy must be extinguished, it's impossible to negotiate anything. Would I/you/anyone negotiate with someone who has stated as a goal to kill you? What can you discuss?.

The only path to peace starts from Hamas stepping down in favour of Fatah. Which is not gonna happen for a million reasons.

How can the leftists be supporting the humans of Hamas who are not really...humans after all, is a serious question that I can not understand from the outside. 

There have been numerous wars that have been televised in the past 30 years (since gulf war I) and since Ukraine we get horrific details of everything that's happening, bless technology for it...The brutality and lack of human emotions demonstrated by Hamas has never been documented before in human history. You can not negotiate with these people. 

It's impossible to trust and strike a deal with these people. Men against fire is real and Hamas fighters demonstrated how it looks like in real life.

Leftists should support more moderate parties like Fatah that stand a chance in delivering peace instead of extending the horror. They are (should be?) getting marginalised for supporting Hamas and their atrocities."

18,07/09/2022 20:14:40,"Asking is not rightwing I'd agree there.  The reason is pretty clear cut.  Lots of Palestinians want revenge for various bad things they have experienced.  The problem is most of them also realize that their ability to deliver damage is fairly limited and Israel's ability and willingness is quite a bit higher.  So they are torn.   What is in their best interest vs. what is emotionally satisfying. 

That being said the easiest way to get Palestinians to not support terrorism would be for Israelis to come up with workable proposals at least in the West Bank.  Gaza may simply be too far gone."

18,07/09/2022 20:14:40,"There are no ""terrorists"" in the Palestinian view of things.  Hamas and Hezbollah are the so called resistance so any attack on them is illegal and against ""human rights.""  In the Orwellian world view of the Palestinians.

If you've got student groups and their professors and one or another anti Zionist retelling of history than this is all moot.

18,07/09/2022 20:14:40,"I don't know if this is going to sound anti-intellectual, but honestly I have very little trust in polls in regards to representing an entire population.

The number they gave for the people they polled in Gaza (not the West Bank and East Jerusalem) was 365. Glossing over how Hamas' existence in the West Bank has built up a reality where not supporting attacks against Israeli civilians can make you a 'traitor', why is it implied that the rest of the millions in Gaza must also overwhelmingly support terrorism? If polls like the one you've linked and ones like [these](https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-shows-large-swaths-of-israeli-youth-hate-arabs-back-revoking-citizenship/) accurately represented either population, I can't help but think there must have been some civil war in Israel by now, as far as I understand Arab-Israelis and Jewish-Israelis largely get along. 

In any case, I don't think most diaspora Palestinians support terrorism, and I don't think most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza would actually be fine with murdering kids or bombing civilian buses because they happen to be Israeli."

As with the Zionists pre state period, the right wing were more able to understand Palestinian Arab nationalism and nativism than left wing.

18,07/09/2022 20:14:40,No it isn't. However it shows ignorance on the topic. I'm no fan of Palestinian terrorism but I full well know why they occur. They occur primarily due to the occupation and the blockade and its humiliating effect on the palestinians.

They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding in the world thay violence only begets violence but this simply isn't true. 

Did Germany rise up after WW2? No, because the allies smashed them so thoroughly that the entire nation of Germany and its people have had all sense of nationalism beaten out of them. 80 years later and Japan can't even talk about the war properly in its school. 

Iraq was the 3rd most powerful country in the world, with a vast and modern military that was motivated and very well funded; right up until the coalition led by the US smashed them into nothing and now Iraq can't even put a stable government together. 

Israel's problem is that it won't commit to ending the problem, much the US refused to end the problem in Vietnam and Afghanistan. They are stuck in a never ending loop of events because they are using ducktape to fix a broken weld."

‚ÄúIsrael is killing Palestinians. They killed Palestinians in 2014 and in 2018. ONE TIME the Palestinians responded and are been called terrorists! That‚Äôs not fair‚Äù‚Ä¶

From this short view, one can understand the ignorance coupled with profound stupidity! They honestly believed Israel will not respond or even forget about the 10/7 massacre!

Edit: another explanation is: Hamas does not represent the Palestinians . They were elected in 2005 with a slim margin. Since then there were no elections and many Palestinians were not born yet at that time. Conclusion: Hamas and the Palestinians from Gaza are two separate and unrelated entities.

In a better world, the politicians who let it happen would take accountability for bad/0 intel,   Slow response times and letting it get so bad and should step down. 

In my opinion a more measured and tactical response would then be necessary, one which doesn‚Äôt indiscriminately bomb apartment blocks and target human shields just because they are being used as human shields.

At that point, no fundamental muslim enemy would stop slaughter you, since your weakness is an indication for a victory. So there is an amount of blood and lands you should charge him back, unless he'll strive for your total destruction. Therefore, Israel's react was driven by pure logic. The only part which is not expected is the respond of the western progressives which don't understand that.

Nobody on the left really supports those wars, and even right wing American figures such as Trump have labeled the Iraq war as a complete mistake. 

The same goes for the intervention in the ISIS conflict. Maybe you don‚Äôt remember, but Barack Obama gave a televised announcement where he basically prepped the public for a boots on the ground intervention in Syria. The public responded with a collective ‚Äúfuck no‚Äù so Obama settled for an air campaign  and a no-fly zone instead, with relatively minor land based operations. 

So, you‚Äôre a looking for an inconsistency in the anti-Israeli side which simply isn‚Äôt there. You‚Äôre going to find very few people who think that Iraq/Afghanistan were justified, but Gaza wasn‚Äôt. 

The reaction to October 7th should not have been indiscriminate bombing of densely packed civilian centers. If the IDF is the moral, elite force of claims to be, it should have been more than capable of a much cleaner operation than what we have seen so far. Either Israel is not the moral force it claims to be, or it‚Äôs not the elite force it claims to be, or both. Almost as many civilians have died in just a month of this conflict than have died during the nine years of the ISIS conflict. That‚Äôs simply an unacceptable reaction and just goes to show that Israel was far more interested in collectively punishing the entire population as a means of deterrence rather than using its supposedly elite intelligence and military forces to target Hamas specifically."

Yousef is proof that one can make their own observations and choose their own path, but only time will tell what kind of state any of these people will be in after 17 years. Plenty in jail who have expressed that their involvement in Hamas was for the purpose of being arrested because they‚Äôd rather be getting a degree in Israeli prison. It‚Äôs also been said civilians left Gaza on 10/7 to do the same, though Hamas wants to pin the event on them. There‚Äôs a lot of moving parts here.."

But if he knows how the problem with radicalism can be solved, why can't he do the same with Twitter?

Muslims learn to hate Israel on mosques, family, friends and middle eastern schools.

Look at Europe and the USA. 

2nd and 3rd generation Muslims who never got bombed once by Israel, hate it. Do people really believe that the people in Gaza are more receptive to peace than those other Muslims abroad?"
23,23/11/2023 23:06:50,"As I said many times before, if fighting one's enemy always backfired like that, no war in human history would ever end.

This type of argument assumes that people hurt in war would want nothing more than keep fighting and dying. In fact, it is much more likely they'll want peace for them and their children.

In any case, we don't and can't know the future. We live in the present. Israel has been brutally attacked, so now it has to respond to eradicate the threat. Everything else is overthinking this."

24,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"It‚Äôs a completely valid question and everybody, especially Palestinians and Palestinian supporters, should just answer it and say they condemn Hamas‚Äô Oct 7th attacks. Do pro-Palestine activists have no understanding of PR and how the rest of the world feels about terrorists and terrorist sympathizers? The world just had their newsfeed filled with a barrage of tapes of Hamas militants savagely massacring entire families of innocent civilians and then of pro-Palestine activists marching in the street seemingly praising it. That makes them see all Palestinians and Palestinian supports as being pro-terror. As being somebody that could happily massacre them at worst, or celebrate others massacring them at best. 

They need to show the rest of the world that there is a huge difference between Hamas terrorists and Palestinian civilians/Palestinian supporters, that they do not share the same values and are not all violent evil people. People aren‚Äôt going to care about the plight of groups who want them and their families dead. Without condemnations and basic humanity from the Palestinian side of the debate, the rest of the world will see them all the same way they see Hamas and have no sympathy for the Gazan civilians dying or the Palestinian activists being doxxed and fired. 

If you want people to care about you and respect your opinion and see you as a human being, you have to show you have humanity too. 

I can 110% unequivocally say I condemn Hamas for the terror attack of 10/7 but that I‚Äôm also heartbroken over the death of every innocent Palestinian and condemn any and all violence against non-combatant civilians. It isn‚Äôt that hard to just be a human being."

In other words - what we choose to **focus** on in a certain time and place is part of the message itself. 

By focusing on Israel's actions at this time, we are effectively diverting the discussion away from the real culprit of the violence in the region, and the only agent that can make it stop for real -  Hamas, as well as the attitude that it promotes, which is also prevalent in Judea and Samaria."
24,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"I agree, people can be rigid when talking about politics. But I think what people are challenging is the notion that pro-Palestinian = anti Israel. 

Who has hindered the Palestinian dream to have their own state and live peacefully? Is it truly the Jews and Israel? Or is it Arab leaders and Palestinian leaders? They are asking you to think critically and look at history. Hamas will direct the responsibility to Israel when in fact, they hold the majority of the responsibility for the Palestinians people‚Äôs hardship. Not all. Israel can certainly do better. But Hamas makes is more difficult for Israel to make choices that will be beneficial for the Palestinian people."

You can be neither. You can also be pro Israel and pro Palestine at the same time. Just don't be pro Hamas.

I personally refuse to have conversations with people who look at Oct. 7th and can't say ""This was a horrible massacre that should never happen again"". If a person doesn't have basic human decency to admit that, then I have nothing else to say or hear from him.

For a conversation to happen there needs to be at least some minimal foundation both sides can agree on. I can't find that foundation with people who support Hamas.

If you support palestine, you're against Israeli policies against Palestinians etc. That's fine. We can at least agree to condemn Hamas."
24,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"And Hamas leadership has been pretty clear that this isn‚Äôt a land dispute, it‚Äôs about killing Jews. Never again means never again, and I hope Israel kills every last member of Hamas."

The very sad truth is that there is not a single pro-Palestinian rally that I heard of, where Hamas was condemned. The rallies started before Israel‚Äôs reaction. So how can they not be pro-Hamas? The slogans ‚ÄúFrom the river to the sea‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúGas the ‚Ä¶.!‚Äù in Sydney, are speaking a very clear language. The fact that such rallies don‚Äôt occur unless Jews are involved, even if Palestinians are involved, is a clear indication of their antisemitic nature."

25,09/11/2023 14:23:06,"> It seems to me like you're more likely to see [an ISIS flag at a pro-Palestinian demonstration](https://x.com/KemiOwonibi/status/1719772152067420461?s=20) than an anti-Hamas message. 

That's not the ISIS flag.

[This is the ISIS flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Flag_of_the_Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant2.svg/800px-Flag_of_the_Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant2.svg.png).

But, I can understand the confusion, let me explain: 

The isis flag contains the sentence "" **ÿß ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸ∞ŸáŸé ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸëÿß Ÿ±ŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÖŸèÿ≠ŸéŸÖŸéŸëÿØŸå ÿ±Ÿéÿ≥ŸèŸàŸÑŸè Ÿ±ŸÑŸÑŸá** "" which in Arabic is a famous sentence every Muslim says, it just means ""God is Allah and Mohammad is his prophet"". It has nothing to do with violence, killing, terrorism, or anything at all.

Sadly, muslim extremist terrorist groups adopt these messages as their slogans. But if you look closely at your video they are just waving flags with that sentence, its very different from the design of ISIS. 

That sentence is just a symbol of belief and faith, sadly it has been massacred by ISIS and now it looks like a scary thing. It's just the same thing with ""Allahu akbar"", it just means ""God is great"" and as Arabs we're used to just saying it between sentences and sometimes at random. It doesn't mean much its just something we do, but sadly now you can't do that cause everyone would get scared.

I would also like to add, that even if someone pulled up the ISIS flag, it doesn't mean that every pro-Palestinian protest supports terrorists.. 

If a guy pulled up a terrorist flag in an Israeli protest, would you say all Israelis are supporting terrorism? It doesn't make sense. Also, it kinda depends on the country where the video is taken, cause cultures are different.

Hope this clears it out for you."

Now we know that the government of Israel was warned by their Egyptian allies ten days before the attack. This has been confirmed by a Republican from Texas.

Why isn't the government of Israel explaining why they were caught off guard? Instead we are getting claims made without evidence for a war with Iran. Bibi's got some explaining to do."

26,12/10/2023 13:07:22,"In fact, the former New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief David K. Shipler has reported that in the early 1980s Israel offered financial support to the Muslim Brotherhood members who eventually formed Hamas, in the hopes that they would check the power of the PLO, which they viewed as a threat. This dynamic has continued into the present: In March 2019, Netanyahu told a meeting of his Likud party‚Äôs Knesset members that ‚Äúanyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas. This is part of our strategy‚Äîto isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank,‚Äù Haaretz reported"

1. The original source for General Yitzhak Segev came from a letter written to New York Times by David K. Shipler, NY Times's Jerusalem bureau chief from 1979 to 1984.
2. If I understand correctly, it seems OP's ""truth"" is meant to be gleaned from a single WSJ article, with emphasis on OP's selection of excerpts that are decontextualized from the rich political dynamics between Islamic, socialist, and nationalist movements discussed in the article itself. All this against the broader backdrop of the Cold War, as laid out by the article.

I think a lot more work needs to be put into the research, contextualization, and analysis before any claims of truth can be staked on this. It's a good start; I'm just not personally convinced one way or another yet."

29,18/11/2023 21:57:13,"Suggest you peruse this poll conducted by Arab World for R&D, of Beit Hurzeit University, located in the WB, of Palestinian opinion from Nov 14.  Both Gazans and WB-ers were polled.

I don't like it, but it's always good to know what people genuinely think.

&#x200B;

* 59% extremely support the Hamas actions of Oct 7. 68% in the WB vs 47% in Gaza
* 75% have very/somewhat positive view of Hamas
* 86% have very/somewhat negative view of the PA
* Palestinians have negative views (very/somewhat) of almost every foreign actor: Hizballah 51%, negative, US 97%, Iran 63%, Turkey 63%, Egypt 85%, Jordan 85%, KSA 95%, UAE 95%, EU 92%, UN 90%, Red Cross 75%, Russia 54%, China 60%.
* The only actors viewed positively are Palestinian terrorist factions: Hamas, PIJ, Al Aqsa Brigade, Al Kassam Brigade
* One State Solution is supported by 5%
* Two State Solution is supported by 17% (slightly more support in Gaza than WB)
* ""A Palestinian state from the river to the sea"" supported by 75%.  (This is the original PLO demand for Israel's destruction.)
* 72% believe Palestine will emerge victorious from the war.  (Seems deluded to me, but there it is.)

What this suggests is that if peace with Palestinians comes, it will have to be imposed from the top down, bc Palestinian people don't want it.  It's not as bad as it sounds, though.  Arab neighbors' peace treaties with Israel have also generally been a creation of the ruling class rather than the Arab street, and yet have stood the test of time.

Perhaps we need to try to focus on what *can* be agreed upon?

Something that I've learned is that Israelis largely seem to feel that they have been let down by their government.

I don't know if this is because they feel that it was a security failure, or a failure to negotiate for hostages, or if it Netanyahu's use of Hamas as a political instrument to deny everyone a two state solution, or whatever.

I hope I don't just get the predicable ""what about Hamas"" replies. Not for this particular comment anyway. I know it's not purely a one sided story.

Plenty of Palestinians probably want this to end as well as Israeli‚Äôs. The Israeli government is way harsher however in light of everything that has come out recently I do think a two state solution is the only way to solve this. Will it happen? Probably not. I guess they will all start killing each other I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm so frustrated and I feel helpless.
29,18/11/2023 21:57:13,"You have to look beyond the borders of this current conflict.

Palestinians don't just hate Jews, they hate everyone.  Any time they are let into another country, they start causing problems, such as Egypt and Jordan.

You've got a lot of other Muslim countries in that area who tried to invade Israel or openly support Palestinian terrorism (Iran).  But they would never let any Palestinian ""refugees"" into their own countries.  They just use Palestinians as pawns to kill Jews.

So there's never going to be any peace in the area as long as these other countries are supporting Palestinian violence."

I don‚Äôt understand why more people aren‚Äôt more angry at Egypt and Jordan for their part in 1967 either. Like.. Egypt is kind of the reason Gaza is occupied by Israel and everyone yelling that it‚Äôs not Egypt‚Äôs responsibility to help them? Eh? For that reason this doesn‚Äôt feel right to be considered truly part of the conflict proper. So long as everyone is not wanting to invite Hamas in to their country and can‚Äôt distinguish Hamas from Palestinian, this is two communities of civilians both struggling because of Hamas. Bibi‚Äôs goons, while I definitely don‚Äôt support them, are not indistinguishable and so that‚Äôs where my hopes for the results come from- the ability to separate peace from violence."

While true, P.A. basic law also guarantees a free press, due process, and other basic human rights that the P.A. routinely violates.

That‚Äôs why Palestinians are not given refuge in the Arab world and are forced to live for generations in crowded refugee camps. It‚Äôs so that they can be used as a tool to further a cause.  

Hamas does not really pretend to care about the Palestinian people.  It‚Äôs only only goal is the Palestinian cause, or the destruction of Israel.

If you support Palestinian people you would be rioting against Hamas, Iran and any other entity that prevents the Palestinians from living peacefully with equal rights in a state of their own.

This might seem puzzling. But my firm belief is that acknowledging the suffering of the civil population of one people while ignoring the suffering of the other is not only immoral. It is one of the key mechanisms underlying the self-perpetuating nature of conflicts. 

Whether you identify as pro-palestinean or pro-israeli I believe that you should have an interest in guarding the civil population of both sides. Because crimes against one civil population can and will be used to justify crimes against the other. This conviction has only been further strenghtened during the past week, where it seem to me that this is exactly what has happened.

See the definition of murder:

>the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another.

next understand the 'lawful' part of the killing by IDF here, which is based on LOAC (the law of armed conflict), Google/YouTube it or see those: [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwpzzAefx9M); [PDF](https://www.genevacall.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Law-of-Armed-Conflict.pdf). 

The lawful part here also explains why IDF isn't considered a terrorist organization but all of the Palestinian ~~organizations~~ militants are.

&#x200B;

This isn't a one comprehensive answer to copy & paste everywhere but one meant for you to understand the faulty logic assumed in the question."
37,30/11/2023 19:19:01,"Here's an answer:

Israel does not target civilians in Gaza, they target Hamas. Unfortunately, it is well known (and confirmed by US, Nato, EU, UNRWA and even Hamas officials themselves) that Hamas is using human shields in Gaza. Namely, Hamas operates within civilian areas, hides behind hospitals and use school as terror bases with the intent of increasing civilian casualties as much as possible when Israel retaliates.

Unlike Hamas, who does everything in its power to kill civilians (both Israelies and Palestinians), Israel is taking multiple actions to save civilians. These actions include:

1. Evacuating 250,000 Israelies from Gaza envelop and north of Israel.

2. Developing the iron dome, an advanced defensive system that intercepts rockets aimed at civilians.

3. Sending pamplets with warnings to evacuate Palestinian civilians from Northen Gaza to safer areas in the south. (Hamas told the civilians these pamplets are Israeli propaganda, shot civilians who went south and blocked the roads)

4. During the war with Hamas, in midst of battle, Israel have risked its own soldiers in order to create humanitarian corridors that were used to evacuate civilians safely. (Hamas launched an attack on Israeli soldiers while they were defending the Palestinian civilians).

5. Text, voice message and even call people in Gaza and ask them to evacuate.

6. Donate incobators to shifa hospital. Tried to donate fuel, but Hamas did not allow that.

7. Helped evacuating 30+ babies from shifa hospital (which was used by Hamas terrorists) to a hospital in Egypt.

8. And much more...

Israelies value life, Hamas values death. If you support Israel you support life and the efforts to reunite the families whose children, babies, grandmother, grandfather, father, mother or other siblings were kidnapped. If you support Hamas you support death, rape, religious hatred (antisemitism), terror, revenge and more actions that are so disguisting I prefer not to even mention here.


Bonus: you can add that Israel have warned  the world for years, including the UN, that Hamas practices human shields. This is known and confirmed for at least 9 years. Yet, the UN nor anyone else did anything about it.

You can also remind them that Israel is the only democracy in the middle east and the IDF is considered to be a legitimate army. Yet, Hamas is officially recognised as a terror organization world wide."
37,30/11/2023 19:19:01,Human shields. IDF targets terrorists and the human shields that surround them die too.

To play devils advocate:

- most of the settlements are in area C 

- this is disputed territory, not inside a Palestinian border, because:

- there is no border, it is a cease fire line from 1949

- many Jewish religious sites are in the WB and Jews should have a right to at minimum visit them and worship

- Palestinians have declined to turn the WB into a country multiple times

In some cases it is a mostly land-grab pure and simple but more often:

In some cases it is strategic, for security to bolster an area with settlers who can act as militia in the case of an attack.

Sometimes you hear complaints that land is being taken by it is by tenants not by owners for example:

In some cases it is less the govt and more private companies. This is hard to understand but of importance.
A Jewish real estate company or individual owns or buys a building, which is leased to Palestinians.
However they worry if a peace deal is made their building will be taken and given to Palestinians since it is in those territories or inhabited by those peoples. So they recruit Jews to live in parts of the buildings, sometimes free or encroaching on the tenants. As an insurance policy so to speak.

In general these things are not good imo- but understanding the reasoning makes things clearer than just ‚Äúthey take away buildings for no good

They usually are imo. They are usually justified by claiming that Israel needs a ""buffer zone"" in the west bank to have some ""safe"" land in between the Jewish settlements and the Arab WB. It has only caused tensions to rise, relationships between Jews and Arabs to be strained, and peace to be less likely, not more.

>It seems like Israel's biggest enemy is its own right wing radicals.

It is. Many Israelis prior to this were protesting against the right-wing government for a number of reasons, mainly Bibi's fraud charges and his plan to weaken the courts (giving the executive branch more power to legislate). I do not support Bibi, and neither do many Jews, both Israelis and diaspora.

As more people immigrate to Israel, either for religious reasons, refugee reasons (yes Jews are still persecuted in parts of the globe), or for other reasons, they need a place to live. The settlements provide an easy and cheap way for many of these people to live in Israel. Not saying this is ethical, but its just one of the reasons why settlements continue to expand.

My hope is after the dust settles in Gaza, a new government can be established in Gaza, and a new leader & party can be elected in Israel - One that is more sympathetic to Palestinians and their struggle for statehood, while also maintaining safety and prosperity for Israelis. For now, all settlement expansion projects should stop."

39,20/11/2015 15:39:18,"Highly relevant article given some conversations I had with other users yesterday. Paywall break:

>Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom is worried by the rising tide of young Swedes who are joining the Islamic State. ‚ÄúHere again, you come back to situations like that in the Middle East where not least the Palestinians see that there isn‚Äôt any future [for them]. [The Palestinians] either have to accept a desperate situation or resort to violence,‚Äù she said. Her remarks provoked fury in Israel, and Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon even called them ‚Äúshocking in their chutzpah. ... [She] exhibit[ed] genuine hostility.‚Äù

>The Foreign Ministry and the many Israelis who hastened to rebuke Wallstrom are wrong this time. Wallstrom may not be a member of the World Zionist Organization, but she is the first important European politician to confirm ‚Äî albeit inadvertently ‚Äî the common argument in Israel that the currents pushing young Europeans into the arms of terror are not different from the currents in our region.

>Muslims living in Sweden, the most generous of all European states to Muslim migrants, join Islamic State for exactly the same reasons that their co-religionists in Mosul, Jenin and Jaljulya throng to it. If the motivation, as the forgivers of the world would have it, is indeed despair, then they are admitting that the paradise provided to Muslims by Europe, and especially Sweden ‚Äî generates despair whose results are no less murderous than those generated in the hell of the Middle East. 

>Anyone who advances the paradigm of desperation ‚Äî including the perplexed in Israel ‚Äî are making a fundamental mistake. Islamic State does not act out of desperation. Just the opposite: It is faith and hope that are driving the Islamic offensive against the free world. The West, captive to the conceit of desperation, refuses to correctly understand this insane hope and as a result it cannot suppress it.

>The symptoms of desperation are the polar opposites of those of faith and hope. The desperate do not believe that they can change reality and are inclined to passivity. The hopeful, in contrast, believe that if they take active measures, even insane ones, they will achieve their goal. In the case of Islamic State it is a global Islamic caliphate that includes, yes, Sweden and France, Germany and Belgium. Even if it is not their primary aim, the Muslim migrants to Europe will constitute the demographic infrastructure.

>The flaccidity of the West is among the accelerators of this hope. The terror acts will expedite the realization of the sacred cause. After all, Allah wants the entire world to follow the path of Islam. Wallstrom, as well as more-senior European and American statesmen, personify this feebleness. If the organizations of destruction felt the death squads had no chance of defeating Western civilization, they would not have moved the arena of madness to Europe.

>The Islamic threat is not like the threat posed by Hitler, but its goals are similar: imposing the reign of darkness over the free world. If this world stops following its heart‚Äôs desires blindly, as it did 75 years ago, it will win this war too. The questions are whether ‚Äî and when ‚Äî it will wake up and open its eyes, and whether it is willing to defeat the enemy decisively, as it did in World War II. Judging by the current situation, the free world‚Äôs moves show that it is not ready, not even after the events in Paris, to go all the way. It lacks the resolution and the right leaders to do so. Like Israel, it will wage operation after operation after operation. And, also like Israel, it will not lack for excuses."

39,20/11/2015 15:39:18,"I wouldn't say that's entirely true... If you honestly believe there is hope within the Palestinian community you're lying to yourself. Polls indicate that the vast majority of Palestinians don't believe a political solution is likely sometime in the future. The vast majority see themselves under a threat and believe that Israel will sometime in the future confiscate their land or destroy their home.

Normally in extreme desperation, extreme tactics will be used. Terrorism is political violence. It's a response to political circumstances. 

There seems to be an extreme difficulty with the word terrorism. The West has terrorized the entire third world in a cruel manner, but of course int he West you're not going to be told that this is a form of terror. To be blunt, it's a ""war on decolonization."" 

Most 3rd world nations have heavily influence by stronger outside powers that for one reason or another found interest in the country; resources, location, support in the region, etc. Normally when a third world nation grows more powerful or independent, there is a wave of excuses used by the West to attack them. The West is scared to see a government that *actually* represents the people and is opposed to imperial influence to hold power in any of these countries. Hence the reason most of West after WWII has supported 3rd world dictatorships and then opposed any national liberation movements. 

What we see in the Middle East to day isn't very different than what happened to 19th century Africa. The US and others were scared of Arab nationalism because it meant the end of Western influence. So it's extremely unlikely the United States and others contributing in the conflict in Syria have the best interest for establishing a stable, representative government in the country. The same goes for Yemen in which the US and her allies have been supporting a dictator, and are helping him in the current conflict... "

Also let me be clear as I represent the ""pro-Israeli"" side - which imo is only a name given by people who don't know that this conflict is not in back and white. WE DO NOT WANT CIVILIANS TO DIE. Ever. If you see someone on either side of this conflict encourage the killing of civilians, know that most of us wholly condemn this.

The reason why Israel is not the same as Hamas is because there is a CLEAR difference between actively targeting civilians and being caught in a crossfire. Hamas targeted civilians, putting it with the likes of ISIS. Israel targets buildings where weapons are being stored or are being used for terrorist planning. When Israel alerts residents to leave and Hamas forces them to stay where they are - civilians lose their lives. This is the key difference that pro-pali supports just cant seem to wrap their heads around. If you don't see the difference I don't know what to tell you. Also the nuclear power comment is silly. Israel will never use nukes on Gaza so this is a ridiculous thing to bring up.

Lastly, people bring up the LGBT thing not to justify killing Gazans, but to show the clear hypocrisy of the pro-LGBT+ crowd who show support to a people who would certainly murder them, while Israel allows anyone to be LGBT+. This again, is not justification for violence, but simply to point out the delusion of supporting a group of people who would certainly not support you back. 

No one is justifying genocide, because there isn't one happening. The population of Gaza has been continuously growing and the goal of the Israeli military is to eliminate Hamas, not all of Gaza."
42,13/10/2023 16:14:03,"Was the video of the Thai man beheaded by Hamas on the day of the massacre not in line with ISIS? 

There various other reasons calling them ISIS besides beheading babies. 

If you‚Äôre going to present the ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù argument, at the very least do some basic research about this conflict. This isn‚Äôt the first period nor time Israel has experienced isolated major terror attacks on their civilians by Hamas. This is a very shocking even because of the scale (1300 deaths in one day) of murder and inhumane behavior displayed by Hamas, like an ISIS milita takeover. But to present the accumulation of years of abuse by Israel on Palestine while being obtuse about the long history of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians as well.. Silly. 

It makes a lot of sense to criticize Pro LGBT organization suffering cognitive dissonance and support Palestinian activism that supports Hamas attacks. No one is criticizing them for supporting UN humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians. People are criticizing them for actively engaging with crowds that shout slogans about dead Jews and believing that the men who would tie them up to their motorcycles and drag them along the streets of Gaza for being gay are not by any means on the scale of ISIS crazy. No no"
42,13/10/2023 16:14:03,"> Biden claimed that he saw photos of beheaded babies... then the white house retracted that claim. 

And the IDF confirmed it on the record.  

> They're using this to justify a genocide against all Gazans, 

There is no genocide going on.  Why would Israel be bothering with expensive precision munitions rather than cheap dumb artillery if the goal were genocide?  This is simply a lie.

> On the other hand, Gazans have been producing proof FOR YEARS of all the civilians, including babies, that Israel has killed, and this has never made a difference to the pro-Israel crowd.

Well no.  In general the pro-Israel crowd finds Gazan policy abhorrent.  Gaza is the one who declared war.  Gaza is the one who insists on attacking.  Gaza is the one who has kept this thing going for 17 years.  Gaza could very easily have decided to be Singapore but they didn't. 

> But if murdering babies makes a group as bad as ISIS... why isn't this line of reasoning also used against the government of Israel 

Because ""murder"" isn't collateral damage. Murder requires specific intent.  Israel tries to hit military targets against an army that does not practice distinction.  That is Hamas doesn't wear uniforms, they don't mark their military buildings and they don't separate them from civilian infrastructure.  That's going to increase the number of Gazan civilian fatalities.  Israel has some responsibility to be cautious here.  But the government with ultimate responsibility for the well being of Gazans is Hamas, their government. 

Hamas, atypically for them, decided to conduct an attack to cause maximum moral outrage.  That's an ISIS tactic.'

> That same logic can be used to justify literally every genocide in the early 20th century and earlier, since nearly everyone was homophobic back then. 

First off the question being raised is that Israel was a leader on these issues in the 1990s.  Just as they (the Yishuv and Israel) had been a leader on women's roles from the 1920s onwards.   Today they are a bit of a laggard so the argument isn't as sticky.  

In any case Palestinians values are mostly in line with the dramatic shifts in the rest of the Arab world.  Those dramatic shifts are very bad, but I think Egyptians and Saudis deserve a lot of the blame and Palestinians almost none of it.  It does however provide one of many many reasons that the Israeli society should be the one to win out over the Palestinian culture.  

As for your historical point I'll briefly dissent.  Societies say in the 1950s certainly were homophobic by today's standards.  But there were well known ""confirmed bachelors"" who had ""stable roommates"". Or ""spinsters"" who lived together.  Tolerance rather than social sanction was a norm.  Many things were considered fine if you kept them quiet.  1950s culture was about agreeing to appear to conform to rigid expectations, because of that actual ideological conformity was less important to them.  Today people can get horribly  disciplined for the slightest misstep.

42,13/10/2023 16:14:03,"> there is a CLEAR difference between actively targeting civilians and being caught in a crossfire

Indiscriminately bombing a densely-populated strip of land is not simply collateral damage. If Israel ACTUALLY wanted to avoid killing civilians, they would've sent soldiers to kill Hamas militants.

>Hamas forces them to stay where they are

If this is true (please provide a source if you have one), again, why doesn't Israel send soldiers instead of carpet bombing? If they know they're going to kill civilians, why do they continue to do it? And how does Hamas force Gazan civilians to stay? With threats of death? If that was the case, wouldn't they try to fight and escape since both options are death? It's not adding up.

>clear hypocrisy of the pro-LGBT+ crowd who show support to a people who would certainly murder them

How is it hypocrisy? There's nothing contradictory about being against genocide. China currently puts Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps; are only straight people allowed to voice their condemnation, since these Uyghurs are probably homophobic? How does this logic work? Again: Everybody in the early 20th century and earlier was homophobic. Are we not allowed to condemn genocides in that period unless we're straight?

>the goal of the Israeli military is to eliminate Hamas, not all of Gaza

Israel bombed more than 200 locations (just in the most recent report that I've seen). Am I supposed to believe all of the 200 locations had Hamas in them? All these flattened buildings are Hamas locations?"

6% of water. 50% of electricity in times of calm for free because Hamas won‚Äôt invest a dime in in electrical infrastructure. 

So is it collective punishment to temporarily cut off non-potable water that serves at a minimal amount? Is it collective punishment to temporarily cut off a percentage of electricity that most people don‚Äôt use while Hamas stockpiles fuel?

This was one of the largest misconceptions towards the genocide argument throughout the beginning of this war. People see ‚ÄúIsrael shuts off water‚Äù and assume it‚Äôs _all_ the water.

It's also why there has generally been *more* violence each time Israel makes concessions, because the Palestinians view the concessions as a mark of weakness on Israel's part and the various national movements use it as proof of the success of their terrorism. This is exactly what happened now with Hamas, because the Israeli Military and Shabak believed that making concessions like allowing Gazans into Israel and funneling Qatari money into Gaza would lessen the desire for conflict. It's also why the previous government gave over maritime territory that Israel controlled to Lebanon, because they thought it would improve the lives of the Lebanese and therefore weaken Hezbollah's power.

I am from Northern Europe myself, but l have dug deep into this for long and know people from the region. 

The attack of Hamas was totally barbaric. Also the collective revenge on Gaza at the moment is out of proportion and causes damage and death MOSTLY to people that were not guilty in any way.

I have noticed in this sub that fanatic supporters of Israel seem very aggressive and find all kinds of excuses for the collective revenge. Using that logic it would be best to nuke whole Middle East to the ground, who cares if ""a few civilians"" would go along, as long as the bad guys on both sides are destroyed. For people outside the region it would be ok, if we follow the logic. 

When l present this analogy, l see that the fanatic Israel supporters basically explode in rage. It is basically and unfortunately very telling. I am really sad that both Hamas and lsrael see that the only way is escalation.

Even if things are very complicated, there are always better things to do than collective revenge (from any side). If this goes on, the craziness will never stop 

And by the way...even if l am far away from lsrael and Gaza, I see what happens can escalate to affect the whole world. That is why I present this analogy. Human kind does not seem to be able to grow up, and now it would really be needed.

Anti-semitism is not related to religion but to ethnicity, that's why the Reich didn't care if you were a religious jew but only cared if you had some great-grandfather who had some fraction of Jewish blood. 

That's a major tenet of anti-semitism, the belief that Jewish blood is tainted and makes you inherently evil and subhuman.  

That's why the majority of Jewish people (and I promise it's a vast majority) support a state of our own where we are able to govern ourselves and protect ourselves from outside forces.

This is only one (marginal?) interpretation of a single line from Talmud, not some universal understanding within Judaism."
49,26/11/2023 19:34:29,"I am answering this from my perspective as someone who used to be Orthodox Jewish and is now secular. From my experience, there is a huge amount of misunderstanding around this topic, including from Jews, but especially from non-Jews who are anti-Israel.

There is a saying, ""two Jews, three opinions"", and this issue is no exception. There is a wide diversity of opinion within religious Judaism about this.

Basically, there are two distinct issues here from the religious standpoint:

1. Should Jews live in Israel during exile?
2. Should Jews have a Jewish state in Israel during exile?

And the second actually includes two sub-questions:

* Should a Jewish state have been founded?
* Given that it was, what should be done now?

Regarding the first question, Orthodox Jews are basically unanimous. It is considered to be a very good thing religiously to live in Israel. The reason is that the land itself is considered holy and there are Mitzvot (commandments) that can only be done in Israel. As doing as many of these Mitzvot as possible is very important to religious Jews, many religious Jews have always had the goal of moving there, even way before Zionism as a concept existed. They didn't care who was in charge--they just wanted to practice their religion to the best of their ability.

Regarding the second, there are a huge variety of different opinions that run from the belief that setting up a Jewish state is completely forbidden to the idea that setting up a Jewish state is extremely important and can help bring the Messiah, and a whole bunch of things in between. In short, I would group the opinions as the following:

1. Religious Zionists: This group believes that setting up the Jewish state is an important step before the Messiah comes and has religious significance.
2. Ultra-Orthodox, or, in Hebrew, Charedim: There is a diversity of opinions in this group, but basically none of them believe what I wrote above, that the state is necessary for the coming of the Messiah.

Some have the opinion that, while it wasn't necessary to establish a state for religious reasons, it is fine that it was done and are happy it exists. Some think that the state never should have been established, but since it was, it is critical to protect it for the safety of the Jews living there (This was also my opinion back when I was religious. I would also guess that it is the most popular opinion among this group, although I am unsure of this.). And some are very against any recognition of the Israeli government, even to the degree of not accepting funding.

This results in the interesting situation where there are people who would be very offended if you call them Zionists (as they personally associate this term with ""Religious Zionists""), but are nevertheless against the recognition of a Palestinian state or a one-state solution primarily because they are worried about safety, not for religious reasons per-se. These people would never fly an Israeli flag, but aren't anti-Zionist in the way that most outsiders think. And many likely would be open to something like a two-state solution if they would believe that the Jews in Israel would be safe. (Of course, the problem is that it actually would have to be safe.)"
49,26/11/2023 19:34:29,"Zionism is originally secular movement actually. But there is a religious stream of it called ""Religious Zionism"" that is well supported in Halahka. Even the majority of religious who believe the ""three oaths"" still apply will say Klal Yisrael takes priority over it.

edit: expand - let me define some things as I see it

* Halahka: Jewish law
* Three oaths: the part of Jewish law which prohibits Jews to create a Jewish state by force. It has a conditional clause, ""the gentile nations do not harm us"". Many Jews (""Religious Zionists"") believe this was violated, the gentile nations harmed Jews, thus not only making a Jewish state permitted, but making it obligatory.
* Klal Yisrael: Lit. All of Israel. The belief that Jews have an obligation to each other, and taking politics which would severely harm Jewish interests or security would be a major sin. This is widely believed by even the most religious Jews, so even Jews who would otherwise believe the three oaths still apply would still not come out too harshly on Israel, especially publicly or to gentiles. Even Satmar one of the most anti-Zionist sects follow this."
49,26/11/2023 19:34:29,"Religious Judaism is zionistic in that settling in and living in the land of Israel is a commandment and the highest ultimate earthly goal for a Jewish person.  

Secular zionists approach living in the land of Israel from a more pragmatic, self-sovereignty perspective.  Since they have been discriminated against and slaughtered every time they've not been the ruling power, they feel the need to have a Jewish state.

These ideas are compatible.  There are a few fringe sects (e.g. neturei karta) that believe and claim it is heretical or disallowed to establish a Jewish state prior to the coming of the Moshiach (the next Jewish king).  However, they comprise somewhere well under 1% of religious Jews.  In fact, some sources indicate that there are only a few hundred to a few thousand who participate in anti-Israel activity.  And they are largely discredited because they have endoresed groups like Hizbullah and the Ayatollah Khamenei, who are openly genocidal against the Jews; which shows there is some other pathology going on with them.

The pont is, both religious and long held cultural values support living in Israel as well as modern ethics related to self-rule.  The idea that zionists are strictly anti-religious is not true anymore, and wasn't even true in the beginning; although most of the early zionist settlers were socialists and left leaning politically."

STOP WITH YOUR LIES!!!!!!!!!!!"

No. It's a minority opinion that Jews should wait till Messiah comes. 

In the Talmud there are the ""three oaths"" which God made between him and the Jews/the world:

1. The Jews shouldn't come to Israel 'as a wall' - en mass.

2. The Jews shouldn't rule Israel without the world allowing them.

3. The world shouldn't torment the Jews too much.

1 & 3 were broken, although 1 was mostly after 3. 

And 2 was fulfilled on November 29th, 1947.

And that is if you even think this three oath concept is legit. Most Sages in history either don't mention it or straight up disagree with it.

>However, it seems like the minority of Israel / Zionist keep telling the world that they are the voices of the majority of the Jewish people‚Ä¶(Which is not true)

>Please help me understand with all sincerity.

Ah? It is very true. Half of the Jews in the world live in Israel, 95% of all the Jews in the world are Zionists.

There's a small, extremists minority known as Neturi Karta which are not only against Israel but weirdly against Jews in general, they're working with Iran and are Holocaust deniers. Those are the Orthodox Jews you see in Pro-Palestinian protests. Even Satmar which generally are Anti-Zionists (they follow the three oaths thing), have issued a ban on Neturi Karta because of how extreme they are. They oppose Israel for religious reasons, but are otherwise pro Israel since they don't like dead Jews."
49,26/11/2023 19:34:29,The interpretation of the Torah offered by the OP is not a universal interpretation among religious Jews.  One sect of religiously observant Jews believe this; but they don‚Äôt reflect the interpretation of most religiously observant Jews.
