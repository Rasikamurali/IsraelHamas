What is their objective anyway, I want to know, I'll wait.   You mean kill ALL Hamas? How would they even know they killed all Hamas.  Do they believe they have them all trapped in the tunnels up north?  So their plan is to obliterate the entire north of Gaza?  Will they stop there?  Since right now they are only killing about 20% or so of actual  Hamas, how many more civilians will that take.  Is Hamas 40K?  You don't see the inhumane insanity of this?

Being ""far left"" or ""far right in Israel, is NOT the same as being ""far left"" or ""far right"" in the western world. The most vocal antisemitic groups in the USA are alt-right groups. They hate Jews, blacks, and essentially almost anyone who isn't white and Christian. These groups probably see this war as the perfect opportunity to fuel both antisemitism and Islamophobia and are capitalizing on it as much as they can, while everyone points fingers at the left. I would be far more concerned about them than a bunch of students protesting on campus.

I also get the feeling that the people who keep complaining about the ""Western left"" either don't understand the distinction, or are doing it disingenuously for the purpose of fabricating a political divide that really does not exist. Or they are doing it with the intent of making the left seem radical and extreme. In the same way that politicians like Sanders, Warren and sometimes even Biden, were labelled as ""radical left"" to scare people into voting Republican. None of the news outlets in the USA that veer left have shown a single ounce of support for Hamas. They have also made a point of interviewing as many survivors of October 7th, so that people see how horrible it was.  And last I checked, the currently Democrat-run government seems to be fully behind Israel, so why all these posts about the left?

It is also very disingenuous for people on this sub to say that the same people who were supposedly cheering after October 7th are the same people who are currently opposing Israel's response to Gaza. But rather than try to understand why students on these campuses are concerned for the state of Palestinians, it is easier to call them ""far left"" or Hamas supporters or worst, antisemitic. Most people I know were absolutely horrified by what happened on October 7th. But they are also very disturbed by the way Israel is responding and feel empathy for the people in Gaza.

Pinkwashing portrays a democratic, liberal and gay-friendly image of Israel, supported by its relatively gay-friendly laws.

They then seek facts that validate their position. They consider themselves intellectual but they are anything but.

Most of the arguments I see in support of Palestine are based around emotion and not fact. People feel empathy because they consider the Palestinians the weaker opponent and so must be the innocent party. Now I am now suggesting that the outcomes are not wholly disproportionate, but most arguments never seem to mention who the aggressor was.  We are seeing this playing out right now. If you go up to the biggest kid in the playground and poke him in the eye, expect to get you ass kicked badly.

I am sympathetic to the Palestinians but I mainly support the Israeli perspective. The arguments I don't agree with are:

Colonization- this argument is used constantly and I don't agree with it. The British took control of the region after WW1, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in a war that they started. I have no idea how this constitutes colonization and if you do then you are denying the existence of nearly every country on the planet. And back then there was no law against it, in fact The right of conquest was recognized under international law.  The fact that the Allies did not start the conflict only supports this claim further. Territorial gain as compensation for the cost and the lives lost in a war that you did not start.

Apartheid: Another term very loosely thrown around the pro Palestine fraternity. All Arabs are allowed to live and work in Israel, they can run in the parliament if they wanted to and can own property. Israelis are not allowed to own property in the Palestinian controlled areas and have no rights. If Hamas and the PLO had more power they would absolutely instigate an apartheid structure against Israelis or even worse ethnically cleanse them completely. This is a stated goal of Hamas in their charter.

All the other wars: Lets not forget that the Arab nations have started every war against Israel with the sole purpose of wiping them off that land. The fact they have been shockingly unsuccessful  at it does not take away the fact they are the aggressors- every single time. And when the consequences of that action result in restriction of movement, walls, territorial loss, they do nothing but complain. Decisions have consequences and often they can be catastrophic.

The Peace Process: When the UN recommended the partition plan in 1947- with a 55/45 split- given that Israel was getting the south with was mainly desert, Israel accepted it. The Arabs did not, not because they did not think the split was inequitable, because they would never accept even 1% of the land going to Israel.

This is not Israel fault no matter how much you try to put it on their shoulders they had no control over the money Gaza received during all these years.

This is why most of civilised countries support Israel they know the investment that was made in Gaza and the huge corruption that is happening there.

* The populace is often misinformed; some may not even be aware that there was no Palestinian state initially.
* Media channels in these regions hide historical facts, such as the events of Black September. Many 'pro-Hamas supporters' may not even know that Egypt sought control over the Gaza Strip, or that Jordan held the West Bank for several years.
* Accusations that 'Israel is a terrorist state' are made by individuals residing in countries like Pakistan, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Yemen—nations known for producing terrorists through their stupid madarsas(so-called educational institutions).
* Many supporters fail to grasp that Israel would benefit from a peace agreement with Palestine (Gaza). Numerous peace treaties proposed by the US, UN, and Israel have been rejected by Arab countries.

Because those are unfortunately blanket statements that can quickly be rebutted with ground evidence. Not everyone is misguided by social media. Your arguments are official truths but they are unsupported by ground truths. 

For instance - Officially, there was unilateral disengagement process from the Gaza Strip in 2005. The ground truth is that Israel still has control over the transportation infrastructure, airspace and maritime boundaries of the Gaza Strip as well as the supplies electricity and water. 

To counter argue what I just told you, you could easily pull up evidence of Palestinians enjoying free movement throughout Gaza with access to the aforementioned items. 

If Israel is no longer in Gaza, according to the official truth, then these statistics would be untrue:  https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/fact-sheet-movement-and-access-west-bank-august-2023

I assume then, that you would tell me that these reports are untrue and biased. Which would proceed with your argument falling into the argumentum ad lapidem fallacy. 

“Palestine was never an independent state” is a fallacious appeal to authority. Regardless of how “officiql” statehood was, those are human beings who descended from that land and have lived on that land before settlement. 

If you truly believe your position, have evidence on hand. Not statements, but ground truths.

3.) BOTH populations owe 50% of their DNA makeup to the Canaanites (literally the first people known to occupy the region BC.) This means, they are related.

And it seems like there might be some bias in how you approach these discussions. It can be exhausting repeating the same memorized points without honestly listening to understand different perspectives. It is equally exhausting to me to see the same talking points parroted by so many. 

You say that Israel left Gaza in 2005, but it's not quite as straightforward as you make it sound. Israel still imposes severe restrictions on movement and trade, and military activities are frequent and ongoing. That doesn't seem to fit the narrative of having completely ""left."" Many serious human rights organizations still classify Gaza as occupied for this reason. (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/gaza-israel-occupied-international-law/)

As for the casualty difference between Israelis and Palestinians, I’d say it is largely because Hamas isn't a fully-equipped military force, unlike Israel, which has one of the most advanced militaries and powerful allies. Israel is not notoriously precise in their operations, with the vast majority of the 11,000+ dead being civilians or children. And I know folks will say “human shields”, “advance warnings” etc… yes, I know the memorized arguments. Yet still, 1 out of every 200 people have died in Gaza. This is a tragedy. 

I do agree with you there is a lot of misinformation and many people are misinformed. The media, propaganda, and rhetoric aren’t helping. that makes it even more important that we all do our due diligence. If it's really a complex situation like many Israel supporters say, shouldn't we all approach it with more humility and willingness to learn from those we disagree with?

If you are feeling exhausted, consider advocating for a Ceasefire – an end to all hostilities on ALL sides, and the release of all hostages, including those captured in Israel on 10/7 AND the thousands held in the West Bank without charge.

Lead with your heart. It's less draining than endless debates. If you find yourself needing to dehumanize or criminalize people to defend a government's actions, it's a red flag that there is likely oppression going on. The reality is, none of these governments have our best interests at heart and we SHOULD hold them accountable. Nobody is safer today as a result of Israel’s actions. 

I'm sincerely not trying to stir up anger, just aiming for an honest conversation. I’m hoping that ALL HUMANS can find peace, safety, and security.

Most states do NOT support what Israel is doing now, and what it has been doing over last 25 years.


The ""2-State"" solution is basically the Oslo I/II agreements - made in 1993-1995.

Both parties agreed to Oslo.

Photos of them shaking hands on it was global news for like weeks.

Everyone was full of hope that they are on a path to calming everything down long term.

But Israel did not honor that deal. Israel made no progress in transferring Area C in the 5 years that it had to do so. Instead, as the deadline drew near, it started pouring ~200,000 settlers into Area C in 1997-2000

When it became obvious Israel is not going to honor Oslo, Clinton tried to rescue it and set up Wye River as the last ditch attempt to at least have Israel start that process and give some... any... of Area C just to keep the hope going. And afterwards Israel reneged to those tiny transfer as well...

All these settlers arriving into Area C is what started off the Second Intifada (2 years after the 5 year deadline that was in the Oslo agreements)

Now 500,000 Jewish settlers are in Area C, and 6 months ago Israeli government ministries were instructed to make plans to move another 500,000 settlers into Area C...

The steady stream of news of injustices in Area C over last 25 years is the reason why so many people worldwide are now waving Palestinian flags instead of Israeli flags.

------------------

Oslo agreement was that a Palestinian Authority (PA) would be established and assume governing responsibilities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period. Israel army was to be allowed access only to guard against external threats (ie: Jordan)

* ""Palestine was never an independent state before 1948"" -> I'm not sure what you mean by that. Palestine was not an independent state before 1948. That's a fact. But It wasn't ""land without people"". There were people there. If you're informed, you will know that Jews migrated to land WITH people. And decided to create a state on land that were owned by people. The Zionist dream was actually fulfilled by several Anti-Semitic men in Europe that wanted to get rid of the Jews living there.

Israel started neglecting Gaza in 2005 and let Hamas run its day to day affairs like thugs. But Israel controls Gaza's air space, sea, land borders (including Rafah, jointly with Egypt), water, electricity, fuel supply, food supply and literally any other activity there. Israel controls what gets into Gaza and what gets out. Gaza is an open air Israeli prison and a Palestinian ghetto. Therefore, as an occupier, Israel has no right to self defense against an occupied territory. For example, the US couldn't bomb Puerto Rico even if it were overrun by gangs and terrorists. It can take action against the gangs, but the US has responsibility towards civilians in Puerto Rico. Similarly, Israel has a responsibility towards Gaza. 

""Palestine was not an independent state before 1948"". Correct, Palestine was a British colony but Palestinian people lived there before 1948. In 1948 many Palestinians were slaughtered and expelled from their homes in what is now Israel and these people have a right to go back to their homeland, even if it wasn't a state. 

""Less Israelis die because Israel actually defends their citizens"". Partially true. Another important thing to add is that Gaza does not have any military or the firepower to attack main land Israel. Israel has sophisticated bombs to carpet bomb Gaza which is what they've been doing. Hamas is a bunch of terrorists who have some firearms and rockets but it's nowhere near what Israel has. But apparently Israel's superior military power is proving to be useless. They've killed 11,000 civilians mostly women and children. How many Hamas terrorists have they killed to show for it?

We know that Netanyahu was being investigated for corruption charges by the left wing Supreme Court, and he was trying to rewrite the rules to make sure they couldn’t remove him for those charges. The country was also bitterly divided, and many secular Jews from the millennial and Gen z generations didn’t care for him, so his approval rating was declining massively. 

So what could a prime minister do to retain his role when his career is in jeopardy? Allow an attack, use the gruesome footage to broadcast to the entire country and world, and unify his people in order to wage war against Hamas. Then he would emerge as the courageous leader who responded to the attacks and led his people to victory by defeating Hamas. 

This was about self preservation for Netanyahu and his haredi parliament, and at his core, he doesn’t give a damn about the Jewish people, and he certainly doesn’t give a damn about the 11,000 Palestinian civilians that died from the more than 7,000 rockets launched on Gaza, all while knowing that most of the Hamas militants were hiding underground in tunnel networks with the hostages. 

This man committed treason against his own people and is now engaging in an ethic cleansing of Gaza. He’s a psychopath of the greatest magnitude and a danger to humanity.

You would be in the same situation if you decided to relocate Israel to Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, or Jordan after WWII, with a large influx of immigrants. 

Any country that is forced to accept mass immigration, particularly in the Middle East, is likely to react negatively as the Palestinians did from day one. 

It is a weak argument to claim that Palestine was never independent. Lebanon had no independence, Saudi Arabia had no independence, and the entire region was ruled by the Ottomans. However, the ottomans assigned administrative leaders to each distinct. Raising the status of various minority groups. It maintained the centuries-old regional names that had been in use; in fact, the so-called insulting name for Palestine had been in use for nearly two millennia. The name is clearly embraced by the locals. The British even acknowledged Palestine as such, there were coins dubbed British Palestine and passports etc of British palestine origin. 

With your definition of an independent country, I suppose England had the right to invade Australia because it was not independent. Killing and murdering all the locals.. Or the invasion of America and its non independent country. 

It is disturbing how you use this to support Israel's ongoing expansion and even the creation of Israel .

Australia for example has been able to recognise the aboriginal people as the original occupiers of the land and they were not even regarded as a civilisation, they were able to prove boundaries using rock monuments and trees. 

Palestinians are constantly being told by Israel that their presence was meaningless. They are getting kicked out of homes they lived in cause they couldn’t provide a title or admin papers and being told the buildings are defective under Israel law and subsequently find their houses being demolished and rebuilt and occupied by Israelis. ? 

How you use this to justify constant expansion practices in Israel is unsettling. 

“Israel's defense of its citizens, while valid, overlooks the constraints faced by Palestinians in Gaza. Lacking an airport, ocean access, and freedom to trade or mine, they remain under Israeli administrative control since 1967, leading to an Orwellian reality.. 

Israel couldn’t integrate  the Palestinians into  the country because it was their country to begin with. . It’s like invading someone’s home and acting shocked that they didn’t want to share the house with you.",2023-11-16 09:24:36

(Please note I am on mobile so formatting is weird)

I would like to start by saying that calling it a conflict is incorrect. This term gives the illusion that both sides are on equal footing. When they’re not. Israel is an occupying military power with billions of dollars in foreign aid/funding from Governments and Corporations. Palestine is the occupied country with no military and no foreign aid/funding of any kind.

Now to your questions:

“Where should the Israelis go?”

Many Israelis hold dual citizenship, with Israel being their second citizenship, and hold a residency in their Birth country (ie not Israel). So wherever they were born and hold that residency. Israelis hold citizenship across Europe and America.

“How do you feel about the people being held hostage?”

We feel terrible about the pp being held hostage. It’s not right but they’re being treated humanely (going off of accounts from those who were released) and Hamas had tried to return more hostages but were denied by Israel.

Now for the other two questions. I am not clear if you are asking for those to be answered or if you’re stating them as examples of the deflection. But I will answer them:

“What do you mean? What about the Palestinians that were displaced where should they go?”

Unlike Israelis, Palestinians only have one home land and our families have been there for generations before Israel was a concept in the British Parliament (1918).

Many Palestinians live in refugee camps in Palestine. Literally Refugees in their own country all because Zionist Israelis forcefully evicts Palestinians out of our homes to make room for more Zionists and create Zionist neighbourhoods.

There are still people alive today who were displaced during the Nekba and are being displaced again because of what is happening in Gaza.

“Okay, what about the thousands of people that had been killed by IDF for decades? What about them?”

The death of Palestinians always exceeds the death of Israelis. For example: in 2008, 899 Palestinians (P) were murdered but only 33 Israelis (Is) were murdered; in 2009,it was 1,066 P compared to 11 Is; 2010, 95 P to 8 IS; so on and so forth.

Even in current events for 1 IS death = 10 P dead (Nov 10- death count 12,254 P & 1245 IS).

Not taking into consideration the inequality of death among the two groups over the past several decades is ignorance. I say this bc pp think what is happening now started on Oct 7 when it hasn’t it’s been happening for years. This isn’t even the first time Israel carpet bombed Gaza. It’s just the first time it’s being televised to this extent.

This doesn’t even consider Palestinians who were murdered for political reasons. One of my uncles (mom’s brother) was beheaded for his outspokenness against the Israeli government, for his stance on LGBTQ+ rights (for), the oppression (against), and some  other issues.

At one point Palestinians were even being killed for holding the flag of Palestine. This is why watermelon is a symbol of freedom and resistance for Palestinians. Not just bc Palestine was world famous for our sweet watermelons but also bc it has the red, black, white, & green of our flag. This is why many pp use 🍉 when speaking about/ showing support for Palestine.

To give more context of slogans. Israel is spreading misinformation about “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as a dog whistle to kill all Jews. This is incorrect. It calls for the liberation of Palestinians from West Bank (by the Jordan river) to Gaza (the Mediterranean sea).

“Free Palestine” again just means to liberate Palestine from the occupation and oppression of Zionist Israel.

1 - There's a general feeling, among the Palestine supporters, that all this ""mess"" is the consequence of colonial meddling of the UK on the Palestinian side of history (UK didn't want to leave too much territory to France, see Lebanon, too close to Suez canal, which was super important), and post-colonial meddling of the USA (with all the post-WW2 guilt-trips you can imagine) on the Israeli side of the history. So in some ways this is ""the west's fault"" (and Israel is also considered western for this exercise), at least as seen by some people in the west.

2 - A general love for ""the underdog"", and Palestine happens to be one (or successfully position oneself as one), especially when compared to Israel. The sheer firepower and military might make it so that Israel is overwhelmingly stronger than Palestine. And that comes at a cost, that you'll be perceived as the neighborhood ""bully"".

3 - That and, well, decades of pro-Palestinian narrative by the NGOs working there, leveraging on this narrative for fundraising purposes, nothing less, nothing more. Israel has no NGOs speaking for them. People like ""needy"", because it makes them feel better about themselves to stand up for those ""in need"", regardless of who's right or wrong. Palestine's story, simply, is more compelling for whatever reason.

4 - No small amount of antisemitism, corroborated by the fact that, in my opinion, Israel does actively nothing to be liked or likable.

In short, to answer your titular question, ""Poor Arabs bullied into a corner fighting to defend my homeland from the colonial invader"" sells more than ""Jews fighting against terrorists with the Iron Dome and anti-missile lasers"". And Hamas is associated (rightfully or wrongly so) to the first portion of the narrative. Israel to the other side.

I think, one should understand the terms right. ”From the river to the see” is not exactly Pro-Palestinian but pro Hamas indeed.
”From the river” or ""Israel terrorris state"" is revansizm and unrecognation of the state in general.

So the question of topic does make sence: people should understands what they are protesting about. Calling anyone terorrist state and has no right to exist gives no basis for any discussion with Israel. 
But it shows support, it's a call for neighbor countries to start a bigger war, it means ”we will support you, we will do anything to help you if there starts a bigger war”. That was Hamas´s leader actually want, basing on the last interview.

It's not about Gazan people, not about hostages, it's about changing borders, changing Middle East whole image.

Millions of Jews has been displaced. The only land that truly belonged to Jews has been conquered so many times by Muslims, most moved on to Europe but then ww2 broke out and again Millions of Jews were murdered. The the world leaders finally saw the the ethnic cleansing of the Jewish People and put them back to the land that was promised to them by Moses a very well respected prophet in Islam, but yet evil marauders kept on spawning and this is now the land they will protect .

I belief you have some very strong points. 

As an answer to your comment on why certain events have not been spoken about (or given media attention) we must first recognize who has created the narrative - the winners. Americans are seen as the good guys because of the victory against the Nazi’s, and so all of their mistakes have been ‘forgotten’. Further, media during that time was no where as strong or as developed as it was now. 

The reason it seems like there is a lot of pressure being put on Israel is because reporters can only really contact them at the moment (no one can walk to up to Hamas, or bring some of the people apart of the organization into an interview). But again, there is a lot of pressure being put on Hamas, and not just through the news. While Israel is receiving little pressure through the news, Hamas is receiving the pressure of bombs (most of them missing target to hit civilians). I have personally been to many protests over the past few weeks and there have been many posters created asking Hamas to stop. There are also hundreds of Jewish people who come to the protests - most of them attending more than I have.

Further, one of the reasons for strong west support for Israel is due to History. Jewish people have faced horrific crimes in the past, especially during World War 2. Since then, there has always been immense sympathy (rightfully so) for them. But with the changing times and circumstances it is difficult to look at the situation without immediately being wary of not siding with Israel (Jews). Without educating yourself through hard facts (not the media, instead using UN - a third party - reports) it’s easy to go in this direction. Further, when viewing Palestine as a Muslim country, people are often taken back to 9/11, and take a pessimistic stance.

If you are able to put past biases aside and create an opinion reading official UN reports, and not those tainted by both sides of the conflict, then you are a wise and intellectual individual. I applaud anyone who has read this all the way through, even when they realize I support Palestine; it shows an open mind.",2023-11-12 11:15:59

Hamas is bad and what they have done on Oct 7 is evil. But to compare the military might and actions of hamas with the zionists Israeli govt is laughable. It is absolutely shocking that a month later we are still talking about this. That we are still having to condemn hamas with the mount of people Israel has killed; the amount of hospitals tbat isreal has shamelessly bombed; the amount of universities (and knowledge contained in them) that is real has bombed.",2023-11-12 05:28:22

Regarding all the “pressure”: despite what Israel is portrayed as in the West, it has never been a bastion of freedom and especially not under Netanyahu.

The other comments completely miss the mark about the history of this phrase and what it means. 

A quick TLDR: it calls for the removal of Israel, and the killing of the Jews there. 

Arabic: من النهر إلى البحر,  min an-nahr ’ilā l-baḥr

The Jordan River (eastern border of Israel) to the Mediterranean Sea (western border of Israel).

In 1948, Sheikh Hassan el-Bana, head of the Moslem Brotherhood, stated that “If the Jewish state becomes a fact, and this is realized by the Arab peoples, they will drive the Jews who live in their midst into the sea.” In 1966, Syrian leader Hafez Al-Assad, insisted in no uncertain terms that, “We shall only accept war and the restoration of the usurped land … to oust you, aggressors, and throw you into the sea for good.”

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said that, “in a final resolution, we would not see the presence of a single Israeli – civilian or soldier – on our lands.” If those lands are ""from the river to the sea"" then clearly they want the entirety of the land Judenrein.

On June 1, 1967, Ahmed Shukairy, then-Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said, “this is a fight for the homeland – it is either us or the Israelis. There is no middle road. The Jews of Palestine will have to leave. We will facilitate their departure to their former homes. Any of the old Palestine Jewish population who survive may stay, but it is my impression that none of them will survive.”

Article seven of the Hamas Charter reads, “the Prophet, Allah’s prayer and peace be upon him, says: “The hour of judgment shall not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them, so that the Jews hide behind trees and stones, and each tree and stone will say: ‘Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him,’ except for the Gharqad tree, for it is the tree of the Jews.”",2023-11-12 13:22:46

There's essentially no recognition of the complexity and humanity of Israel and Israelis. How can you move from there?

Israel are always framed as in the wrong when it's Hamas who have instigated this war, it's Hamas who deliberately target civilians as their policy, it's Hamas who call for genocide, it's Hamas who have used Gazans as human shields, it's Hamas who glorify the Gazan dead as martyrs, it's Hamas who are fighting to install a hateful caliphate in place of a liberal(ish) democracy. The fact that pro-Palestine marches are not anti-Hamas marches means I can never comfortably associate with them.",2023-11-12 14:11:09

Israel has been a hub of innovation, everyone ive met from Israel is unbelievably smart. Their zeal for development is huge. But i think it may be better for Israel to exist not in the Middle East. Zionists complain about Israel being in a sea of institutionally Islamic nations that are institutionally antisemitic in addition to saying that they are one of the only real democracies in the Middle East, and you look at even the secular republics and they have a lot of problems with checks and balances and being de facto dictatorships in addition to having lots of problems governing over militant sectarian groups that essentially set up their own regimes within sovereign territory. This makes it necessary for Israel to always fight, always have massively equipped military. There is also rationale for Israel to have some amount of control over its direct neighbors - the West Bank and Gaza. First of all, the resources and money needed to maintain such defense systems seems vast. And that seems like such a waste. Imagine what Israel could accomplish if they didn’t have to take all those steps to secure such intense systems of defense. Costa Rica doesn’t have a military at all. Wouldn’t that be a better situation? In addition, the steps that Israel has to take to secure such defense, to much of the world, *look like* systems of oppression of their neighbors. If Israel’s necessary defense systems (and it’s questionable how necessary something like controlling all the entry points of Gaza or having military checkpoints throughout the West Bank are necessary) didn’t look oppressive to much of the world, these are conversations we wouldn’t be having. So as crazy as it might seem, Israel could thrive much more if they were to purchase new territory and transplant the country there. Seems crazy but I seriously think it’s worth considering. And considering the ongoing absurdity of Israel/Palestine relations and the reactions of the rest of the world, it doesn’t even seem that crazy to me. 

But in any case, if that’s completely out of the question, I think that the amount of dispossession that Palestinians have had to endure over the years beginning with the creation of the state of Israel has been extreme and should give you pause. Palestinians were forced to abandon their farmland and businesses, their homes, their communities, because Israel beat them in a military conflict. The initial proposed two-state solution would have had much of the same impact,albeit to a lesser extent, and it makes sense why Palestinians would reject the initial partition. They would have to move and Israelis would get to move in no matter what. What should have happened was a two state partition in which no one felt forced to move from where they were already living. 

At this point, there’s not really any turning back to that point and neither side will agree to a two state solution of any sort, which brings me back to the first point. Or Israel could keep doing what they’re doing which scholars have written about negatively.",2023-11-12 16:18:15

It started with a socialist idea: unite the working class. Show up at coal miner strikes and stuff. Then ""the working class"" got generalized to anyone low in any hierarchy: gays, women, black people, and more recently, the West v. the Global South.

So how did Israel, a nation of refugees fleeing The Middle East, Europe, and Africa to their ancestral homeland, become all-powerful, colonizing, ""The West""? The Soviets were the ones who started the rumor about Jews being a secret Western force, back when ""West"" meant U.S. rather than Soviet. So the Soviets attacked the Jews and forced them to flee to Israel. Then the Soviets wanted to expand their sphere of influence into the Muslim world, so they funded Arab revolts against Israel. Both Soviets and Arabs considered Jews ""evil Westerners"" who should go back to where they came from. The Russians wanted the Jews to go back to Israel, and the Arabs wanted Jews to go back to Russia.

The Muslim world of course considers itself part of the Global South that has been humiliated by the West. They blame Israel for the West because 1) their friends the Soviets called the Jews ""evil Westerners"" 2) Muslims consider a Jewish country a humiliation to Islam, since Jews are supposed to live as dhimmis under Muslim rule. So it was easy for the Muslim world to call Jews ""Western oppressors,"" and the far left just bought it without looking into any of this.

By the way, Hamas actually talks about the Elders of Zion, the Russian Bible of Antisemitism basically, in their charter. Their charter goes on for paragraphs with old Russian conspiracy theories about Jews.

Neither the Muslim World nor the far left actually care about Palestinians any more than they care about Syrians or Yemenis. Israel is just a convenient scapegoat for its ally and their common enemy: The U.S.",2023-11-15 21:38:44

It was a huge eye-opener for me as, while I knew that the subreddit in question had a pro-Palestine bias, I really didn't think that I said anything controversial (in fact the comment that got me banned was upvoted).

Since then I've maintained a general support for Palestine, partly fuelled by the horrific scenes of the war, but also because I've repeatedly been told by the left about how Palestinians have been persecuted and marginalised by Israel over the past 75 years.

But what I've come to realise is that I'm actually pretty ignorant on the subject. I'm trying to educate myself on the history of the region, but it's difficult as every source seems to be pushing an agenda. Some people will tell you about the atrocities of the ""Nakba"", but will fail to mention that the 1947 civil war was started by Arabs murdering Jewish civilians in response to being offered their own state by the UN. Others will tell you all about how the Palestinians have repeatedly refused the offer of a two-state solution, while sweeping the treatment of Palestinians in Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the rug.

I still haven't fully figured out where I stand in this conflict, but I'm trying to educate myself as best as I can.

But back to the ""Left"". Israel has grown into a formidable power and Palestine are seen as the underdogs. I think that a lot of people don't take the time to educate themselves properly and simply see it as the good guys vs the bad guys. And when they do try to educate themselves, those on the left (especially on Reddit) turn to their echo chambers who tell them about all the bad things Israel have done, while downplaying and making excuses for the monstrous actions of groups like Hamas, who are (to them) just blameless freedom fighters.

It ends in a seemingly hypocritical state of affairs whereby the ""left"" now support an organisation who openly support ethnic cleansing. Who throw LGBT people off of rooftops. Who want to create a theocratical ethnostate. All things that leftists claim to be against.

There have always been Jews in the region currently known as Israel, yet the average uninformed ""leftist"" will tell you that all Jewish Israelis are ""settlers"" or ""colonisers"" who have stolen the land. Yes, the Jewish population grew after WWII, but the Jews who came in weren't colonisers, they were refugees. The same ""leftists"" are usually pro-refugee rights when it comes to anywhere else in the world.

One final point on the hypocrisy of the Reddit ""left"". A lot of the left-wing echo chambers will tell you not to support Ukraine, who are quite literally fighting off a foreign invader, because of the existence of groups such as the Azov battalion. The very same people will brush aside the atrocities committed by Hamas and say ""they're just fighting for their freedom"". Total hypocrisy.",2023-11-16 10:34:11

The reason is because, while all of those things you mention are left wing or progressive INSIDE of the West, the overarching structure of left-wing belief for at least a century (but especially over the last 50 years) is that the West oppresses other societies/cultures. That's the main pillar of left wing thought -- that the rest of the world is poor, distressed, conflict-ridden, etc. because of the West. 

So this gets left wing people into a huge pickle when these things come into conflict. Islamic societies typically deprive women of equal rights, for example, but the left doesn't talk about that much because it would seem to be ""interfering"" in non-Western societies. That's why Margaret Atwood writes The Handmaid's Tale about the United States and not about the Islamic world, which would be far, far more appropriate and relevant. And this division/contradiction extends to a million different things. You've pointed out some of them yourself. Left-wing people regret and disapprove of regressive practices in other countries, but they can never truly bring themselves to critique them the way they deserve to be critiqued (which is harshly). It would be too ""imperialist,"" ""ethnocentric"" or whatever to do so. 

They're much more likely to claim that the mistreatment of people in other societies is BECAUSE of the West, i.e. the West screwed them up. So that's why, while Hamas has a belief system right out of the Middle Ages, is barbaric in its behavior, and hates anything the left in the West might approve of, it still gets something of a pass, because it's representing the interests of a (supposedly) oppressed non-Western population. And Israel, obviously, is seen as a bastion of Western liberalism.",2023-11-16 00:30:43

Lefties were and are allies of Ukraine (generally speaking). It was conservative:republicans who support Russia. (I’m speaking as an American btw). 

China is spoken of once in awhile. I don’t have enough experience to know what side these young ticktockers have chosen yet. Luckily China hasn’t been twitchy lately, that I’m aware of. Maybe they’re interested in how Israel creates an outcome first (and Ukraine for that matter). Honestly if both Ukraine and Israel win without US and allied involvement with personnel, China isn’t one to hit the piñata. They’ll lay low awhile.",2023-11-16 00:02:47

Israel has violated more than 30 UN resolutions and has been accused of war crimes for decades. 

Palestinians who live in the West Bank live under a military occupation and therefore face military courts, whereas Israeli settlers who live on illegal settlements built on the SAME land are subject to Israeli civil and criminal law.

 It's essential to view this conflict beyond the Israeli public relations lens. Israeli officials have acknowledged that Hamas served their interests in achieving certain goals. The situation isn't solely about Hamas at this point, bro.

While Israel is still marginally justified to defend itself, there is no denying Israel has prodded Palestine into a corner and is enjoying playing off the response that Palestine answered to continued Israeli encroachment onto more and more of their land.

The reason many Leftists are siding with Palestine (NOT HAMAS) is because the tactics used by Israel to gain this victim status and justify further retaliation against Palestine are eerily reminiscent of right-wing playbook tactics, especially the ones Hitler used to justify invading Czechoslovakia.

Israel is a member of the United Nations, an ally of the West and the self-proclaimed Chosen People. They should be held to a higher standard. In fighting terrorists, they should take care not to adopt the tactics of terror. Israel should be the bigger person in the room and negotiate a ceasefire, not escalate the tensions through blockades and continued bombing of public infrastructure for the sake of nabbing a few terrorists here and there. Yes, Palestinians are using guerilla tactics, but that's the price of the dance. If Israel wants to stay on its land in peace, it must be prepared to cuddle the cornered dog, no matter how hard it bites back. Israel's responses to Palestinian resistance so far has been akin to a grown man dropkicking a child that spat paper wads at them.

Palestinians, on the other hand, bear the responsibility to demand a new representative government other than Hamas, but the reality is that Hamas will kill any internal opposition and has the entire people at gunpoint. Israel should realize this and work more subtly to take down Hamas (with, say, fly-sized drones that assassinate with potent neurotoxins, instead of striking buildings at random) instead of taking advantage of inner turmoil and using Hamas as an excuse to further expand into Palestinian territory.

Israel is a legitimate government, not a terrorist state. It has the responsibility to play by the rules, even when its opponent is not. They have the power to end this very quickly and with minimal casualties, yet they continue to choose hate. It should be no surprise that many leftists foolishly choose to side with Hamas. Israel is not making itself a very appealing choice and is relying too much on America's fascination with its Biblical connections to get itself slaps on the wrist",2023-11-16 10:07:57

Our Lord, we are ashamed of our inability to help our brothers in Palestine.

We are ashamed of our weakness, but Ya Rabbi, we have You, who owns all that exists.

Our Lord, you are our protector and helper.

Ya Rabbi, help our brothers in Palestine as you helped your Beloved on Bedr and as you helped us in Bosnia.

Ya Rabbi, our brothers are hungry, so feed them.

They are thirsty, so you give them water.

They are upset, so you calm them down.

They are weak, but they trust in You, Lord, so don't leave them.

Ya Rabbi, the oppressor in your blessed land, suffers, persecutes, kills them. 

O Lord, destroy the evildoer and the one who sows disorder on earth.

Lord, strike fear into their hearts, break their ranks and disable their weapons. 

Ya Rabbi, you are powerful and we are powerless so help them.

We are ashamed, Lord, of our weakness. Ya Rabbi, help them, unite their hearts in the fight on your path and give them victory.

In Israel you also hear about people raising their voice against the government, protests in the streets, going out in public against ministers.

Second, collective punishment stands for a penalty or sanction given to innocent civilians. Killing/siege/not donating food or water and not allowing aid do not fall under these categories. Examples of collective punishments would be to give each Gaza civilians a 500$ fine, or to order all Gaza civilians to do community work, or go to jail etc...

Israel existed in that place, populated by Jews, between 3200 and 3800 years ago, depending on which historians you believe.

**The land should belong to those who owned it.**

Jews have maintained a constant presence in Israel since they came there from Egypt, some time between 1900 and 1200 BC, despite being conquered and expelled multiple times.  In 637AD, Jerusalem was a Christian city and had been for hundreds of years.  Muslims conquered it in 638AD, but the Jews remained.  The area changed hands a few times during the crusades, but ended up in the hands of Saladin.  Fearing the return of the crusaders, the Muslims destroyed coastal cities and filled in harbors to prevent sea landings.  After the death of Saladin and the fall of the Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluk dynasty continued this policy, leading to the area becoming desolate and largely uninhabited by the late 15th century... but still the Jews remained.  After Spain kicked out the Muslims who had held the country for several hundred years, they banned both Jews and Muslims from the country.  This led many Spanish Jews to go to Israel (which under the Mamluks was part of Syria).  There are several contemporary accounts from travelers of the time regarding how unpopulated and how much of a wasteland the area was.  There were small populations in a few cities, but little else.

Interestingly, the first significant migration of European Jews back to the area after the migration from Spain came under Sultan Selim II, in 1558, who encouraged Jews to move to the area.

Napoleon conquered the area in 1799 and planned a Jewish state there, but the idea was shelved after his defeat at Acre.

There were a couple more attempts to create Jewish communities over the next century, mostly sidelined by Druze revolts.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, European Jews began moving back to the area in numbers due to persecution in Europe.  The Jewish National Fund was established during this same period, to purchase land in Israel.  The fund purchased land from absentee Ottoman landlords, who thought they were putting one over on the Jews by selling them deserts and swamps.  The Jews promptly irrigated the deserts, drained the swamps, and built an economy.  To this day, the Jewish National Fund is the single largest landholder in Israel.

**The land should belong to those who set up a country there.**

After the Central Powers lost WWI and the Ottoman Empire was broken up, the League of Nations gave the UK the Mandate of Palestine with the purpose of setting up a Jewish homeland.  When the League of Nations was replaced by the UN, the UN voted to create a Jewish Homeland in the space, and a Palestinian homeland, via the partition plan.  The Jews accepted the agreement, all Arab nations voted against it, and the Arabs immediately began a civil war, so the plan was never implemented.  When the British Mandate ended, the Jews declared their own independent state, according to the UN's plan.  ...and all of their neighbors immediately declared war on them.

**The land should belong to those who won it by conquest.**

When all of Israel's neighbors declared war on them in 1948, the idea was to push the Jews into the sea.  It didn't work out that way.  The Arabs tried again in 1956, 1967, and 1973.  It did not go as they'd hoped.",2023-11-16 08:29:37
