"I agree. The amount of misinformation being spread on account of history is only breeding more hate and reducing the conflict to Israeli apartheid. The current optics aren’t good, even the current regime’s action against Palestinians in 2022 and 2023 aren’t justified but the entire reason for tensions to begin with is not about Israel being greedy. It was about fighting for their right to exist but it turned into aggressive form of protection violating many human rights’ guidelines. You can choose to argue only on the current optics (what’s happening with the civilians) but acting like pundits on Israel - Palestine and knowing the whole issue and than rebranding Israel as a US like oppressor seems a bit far fetched and then to deny the kind of extremist groups that actually pose threat to Israel from all sides. You cannot undermine that, but the progressive liberals have really done injustice to the truth this time. I am sick to my stomach. This is just going to breed more anti-semitism and Islamophobia",2023-10-15 08:45:04
"Believing anyone is the good guy or bad guy is historical ignorance. 

The real victims are the countless innocent people who have died on both sides.

Israel delude themselves they have no choice but to bomb Palestinians, and Hamas terrorists delude themselves into thinking they have no choice but to murder Israelies. 

Bombings create more terrorists who murder in revenge who get bombed in revenge. 

The cycle of revenge keeps the war engine running.",2023-10-15 03:40:22
"I say it's 2 organizations that are evil in their methods that fight each other and civilians of both side suffer and perish.

For the creation of Israel, it's kinda yes and no. Were British in their right to give land? If the British were to give these lands, why did Israeli terrorist bombed a place? Israel using the antisemitic shield every time you criticize what they do is extremely obnoxious.

Protecting civilians is alright, defending yourself is alright. Ask yourself if what is happening is inside the scope of defending. This is BN doing what he always wanted to do, massacre it's just a casus belli, a greenlight. I'd also not be surprised if he actually knew it'd happen and let it happen so that he can have his green light.

This is a deportation through violence and genocide, nothing else.

Everything I said is I think a neutral conclusion based on the facts.

Now my opinion is the following: I'd rather have Israel ruling the ME than the others. But my wet dream would be Israel And the ME nations taking themselves out. Religious country must fuck off so that we can one day move away from these bs.",2023-10-15 22:57:17

"As you say, the british ruled over Palestine and decided to assign the land to Jewish settlers. That sentence already contains 2 parts that are very frustrating, being rules by a small country 1000's of km's away AND having to give up land for no reason that concerns you.

The Jewish settlers were in general richer and funded by Jewish families who wanted to strengthen this foothold near Jerusalem. The settlers grew their communities quickly and started building walls around their communities, often redrawing the lines to also include areas with natural resources. Of course more immigration followed the second world war. This indeed reached a breaking point where the Arabs had enough and wanted to absolve what the British had started in 1918. It is easy to boil this down to 'they hate the Jews, so they wanted to kill them all', but that completely ignores what is geopolitically behind this revolt.

It is also not 'rightful' to take land of the ones that try to stop you from doing just that. The Israeli's wanting to have a land of their own and needing more and more land 'to protect themselves better' is not a blank check to settle in someone elses teritory and 'coincidentially' ending up with 75% of that land after a few generations.",2023-10-16 04:16:31
"Honestly your understanding of the history is pretty poor and missing a lot.

You should start your research with the Balfour declaration in 1917. When the Ottoman Empire fell at the end of WW1 Britain took over that land.

This is when Jewish migration back to what is now Israel really began. 

In 1948 over half the Palestinian population fled or were expelled from their homes during the war which was included neighboring Arab states.

Then in 1967 a half a million Palestinians were displaced during the war.

Look, there is no supporting what Hamas did but Israel isn’t without blood on it’s hands either. This is coming from someone who’s family members have been on birthright trips to Israel. There is nothing holy about that land. I do not see God there. I do not believe there will ever be peace there.",2023-10-17 01:16:42
"i am neither israeli nor palestinian, and after reading alot and speaking to many, it seems that there is no reason why both cannot live in peace together.  Thus, its seems the terrorist groups always seem to attack or cause trouble. I am not saying both sides have done bad things, but there is no reason the Arab countries should not 1. help Palestinians, and 1. try and live in peace and 3. condemn the terrorist groups.",2023-10-15 16:08:53

Sounds like the Palestinians are terrible at war. It's evident when you see the videos of hamas during their recent massacre. Had the Israelis had any armed citizens they would have easily taken out them out,2023-10-16 15:39:16
"Agreed.  Even if you were to reject Jewish religious/historical connection to the land they were displaced from in 70CE, the trickle of Jews in the late 19/early 20th century were small religious or communal agricultural groups adding to the Jewish population that never left.  The later migrations are very clearly refugees.  Either from the holocaust or being expelled from countries with hostile anti Jewish populations, usually Arabic.  Very far from colonialists.  Further, in the 1948 war Israel did not ""drive Palestinians out"".  There are large Arab populations all throughout Israel.  They can vote, own businesses.",2023-10-17 12:54:05
"Cmon bro use your brain. You think Israel won a fair fight and gained the land through conquest? No. The western powers used Israel as a puppet and funneled their might to obliterate the Palestinian people. They continue to build settlements on the West Bank which even the UN recognizes as illegal.

Imagine China takes over New England, offer to give us New Hampshire back and then calls us the terrorists for fighting to get our land back. The difference is that Israel has the support of the United States while Palestine does not. We haven’t even got into the nakba expulsions or Israel’s human right violations in the West Bank. 

If you support Israel, you support colonization and you would have been on the side of France during the Haitian revolution",2023-10-19 01:36:07

"How far back do you want to go? To the Ottoman empire? The roman empire? The Jewish people have a 3,000 year history in this land, as evidenced by extensive archaeological records, like the Dead Sea Scrolls and countless other examples. 

I think a fair thing to do do in the modern age is maybe to disregard the ancient history, and maybe follow international norms, treaties, conventions, et cetera. If you look at a map, the attacks occurred on Israel's sovereign territory, 1949 borders. Unless you deny Israel's right to exist within those internationally recognized borders, what are you even talking about? Of course the history is longer than OP pointed out.",2023-10-15 03:53:34
Israel warns them to leave the area prior to bombing. They aren't intentionally bombing Palestinian civilians. They chose to ignore the warnings. Not much difference between that and ignoring the forest fire raging towards your house and burning alive in it as a result.,2023-10-15 09:35:46
This is the right answer. Totally on point.,2023-10-15 05:19:43
">Bombings create more terrorists who murder in revenge who get bombed in revenge.

This is a very naive take on the islamic fundametalist worldview. Israel could have bombed no one ever, and the Arabs and Palestinians have equal fury and desire to murder every Jew in the middle east. ""it's retaliation for taking our land and dropping some bombs!"" is propaganda that doesn't stand up to actually studying what is going on and the worldview of muslims in the middle east. They want to murder every Jew, drive them into the sea, and take all of Israel for their own - and all of these exact motivations would exist even if Israel never did killed one person or dropped one bomb. That's the sad reality.",2023-10-16 16:00:49
"I get where you are coming from. I also get the philosophical stance of somebody gotta stop the war. But realistically, does that work? We have to first acknowledge there are Islamic extremist groups across the Arab counties bordering Israel and they pose a real threat to Israel (without going into the history of whose land it is or it isn’t). Now that doesn’t mean all Arabs wish death to Israel but the extremist groups do. Israel has been harsh in its policy to protect itself and has also received criticism from within their own country - but I sometimes really wonder how is a nation supposed to protect itself from extremist groups. I have no answers really. And that’s the sad part and it’s this reality which leaves the civilians in a lurch. Ultimately the State > people, sadly",2023-10-15 08:53:18

The real issue is in 1948 the UN removed 700000 Palestinians as a way to compensate Jews and not have to host them in Poland and Germany near the same people who actively or passively tried to eliminate them. 

I agree 100% that by attacking from all sides they lost the land that made strategic sense for Israel to keep and those treaties need to be honored.

Hamas specifically crossed into Israel's internationally agreed, sovereign territory, and in a premeditated attack, purposefully killed, mutiliated, raped, and murdered civilians, ranging from babies to grandparents.

By contrast, Israel express military aim is to take out Hamas, the belligerents, not to purposefully kill civilians. Israeli soldiers who shoot or beat civilians go to jail. It's a crime in Israel.

"I think you may have your definition wrong. I didn’t say murder them all. I said force them to relocate. Then destroy everything they leave behind. They take their culture and people with them. That isn’t genocide. 

The problem is with both Iran and Palestine is they flat out refuse to acknowledge historic fact or legal ownership. Jews have lived there since the beginning of recorded history. Israel is a legal, recognized state - a country. Palestine is not. They won’t come to the negotiation table recognizing that Jews and Israel have the right to exist. They (Hamas, Iran) only want to destroy and kill all Jews (actual genocide by definition) as they have during their attacks. Murdering women and children, cutting off babies heads, killing kids in front of parents, raping women. Killing in the most horrendous ways. That is Palestine. That is Iran. Would you allow someone to be your neighbor that does this or would you force them out?  You would remove the threat or yourself from the situation.

"I think their historic tactics speak for themselves. 

1: Attack a helpless civilian population, kidnap people, retreat back to Gaza.

2: Use captives and high population of civilians to hide. 

I don’t think they thought this attack would be as successful as it was - which leads to; I don’t think they thought Israel would respond as harshly as they are. 

Ultimately, I think Hamas is willing to sacrifice as many civilians as it takes for them to remain in power. Their actions caused 1,200 Israeli deaths and 1,500 Palestinian deaths. Both sides will lose much more before this is over. 

Israel has to end Hamas to make sure this never happens again. 

Bad spot to be in for both sides. Too much loss of human life. Sad to see where this goes from here.",2023-10-12 19:01:56

"Did you read the news on Saturday? They did exactly that. They seized almost all kibbutzim and IDF bases around gaza and tried to hold on to them. They failed. 
It’s not that they don’t try; it’s that they are very lightly armed, have terrible tactics and no discipline, and actually WANT TO DIE. They run into battle shooting without aiming, shouting to Allah at the top of their lungs to make themselves easy targets. They went into battle with no food or water or ammo. They have no logistics to supply an assault. 
So on top of being hateful murdering bigots, Hamas are just stupid. So they will all die now and take a huge number of their families with them as unwilling human shields. 
Every person that dies in Gaza now was killed by Hamas, regardless of whose weapon killed them. 
As sure as Hirohito destroyed Hiroshima and Hitler destroyed Germany, Hamas is destroying Gaza.",2023-10-13 07:22:30

The main infrastructure that hamas has is the tunnels underneath Gaza. They use the tunnels to freely move under the city, attack and retreat. That means most of Gaza's infrastructure has a military target under. Probably part of hamas' long game; It creates more support for Palestine when Israel bombs them, the victims are considered martyrs and some of the survivors become hamas.",2023-10-12 23:02:15
