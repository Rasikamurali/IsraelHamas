IsraelPalestine,"Hamas is a TERRORIST org like ISIS, Al Qaeda or Taliban",,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"People are forgetting that Hamas is as much a terrorist organization as ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Taliban

Hamas has actively killed any political rivals such as Fatah as they are not Islamic enough. This is what the Taliban and Daesh do, kill any peaceful political Muslim rival parties and use Fascism to get into and maintain power under the guise of religion. 

This is a catastrophic shortsighted blunder by Hamas, not only are they descending upon Israelis like ISIS style Jihadis, the whole world will see the obvious terror outfit this organization is. Muslims will make themselves more liable by siding with Hamas as they lack the nuance to see Palestine without a terrorist organization like Hamas being it's representative.

Most are too politically naive to realize that you don't poke a bear you can't fight. These guys have a few rockets and Iran backing them for their own nefarious political gains, that don't even align with the Palestinians long term safety in mind. You really think you can yell Allahu Akbar and take on the Israeli or US militaries. Do you want them to carpet bomb you? Hamas is being as suicidal and as unplanned as you'd expect from typical inbred Jihadis. 

This has never been a simple battle between Palestine and Israel. Israel is a strategic country, almost like a forward operating Base and it's existence will be maintained no matter what by western nations for their control in the middle east. Are Muslims this politically naive? Look at social media right now 

You don't mess with Nuclear armed nations. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened barely 70 years ago.

Edit: For reference I'm an ex Muslim from Pakistan who grew up supporting Palestine his whole life only to realize that Hamas and Palestine is just a front for Jihadis","['Hamas definitely not winning any hearts and minds around the world with their level of indiscriminate, barbaric savagery against innocent Israeli civilians including women, children, and the elderly, but also foreign nationals. ü§¶üí©üí©', 'No videos of Israelis launching rockets at Gaza shouting ""god is great!"" while women and children die.

The goal of Hamas is to massacre Jews not establish a thriving Palestine state! Hamas and Hezbollah serve the interest of Iran."", 'Yes!

It doesn‚Äôt help that some groups immediately jumped to ‚ÄúIsrael started it‚Äù rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don‚Äôt understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. \nI sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas‚Äô shoulders.

If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn\'t listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace.', 'The Palestinian supporters on my social media are saying ‚ÄúIsraelis don‚Äôt care about their hostages because they are bombing Gaza (with a Hamas fighter here or there). Israel just wants destruction.‚Äù I was flabbergasted when I read that. First by saying so casually a Hamas fighter here or there bc Hamas actually did bomb a Gaza hospital so that‚Äôs their justification. And second, I promise as a non Palestinian Muslim woman posting that, if you were there in the country you would NOT be spared by Hamas even if you shared their religion. The supporters are protesting while going back to their comfy homes in the States not even comprehending that if Hamas was in the States, even if you supported their country for ‚Äúresisting against oppression‚Äù, they would literally not spare you.', 'Hamas is aided by Iran .']"
IsraelPalestine,Is IDF a terrorist group?,,17/11/2023 09:46:32,"Another funny claim by Muhammed Hijab is that IDF is a terrorist group because they killed X amount of people.   
This needs to include the basics of our law systems and basic logic.   
Let's start with a basic example: 

1. One person woke up to find an intruder in his home aiming a gun at his wife, he shot and killed the intruder.
2. Someone goes to a shop for a robbery and, in the process, murders the shop owner.   


Are they both having the same responsibility? Are they both murderers? Of course not!   
What does Oxford say about terrorism?

>The calculated use of violence or threat of violence to inculcate fear. Terrorism is intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological.

* Does Hamas try to intimidate Israelis? Yes
* Are Hamas's goals political and religious? Yes
* Which group tries to maximize deaths, Israel or Hamas? Hamas
* Which group killed 20x more people per hour? Hamas
* Now, is Israel trying to Intimidate Palestinians? No, it tries to help them to escape. 
* Does Israel have any political goal? Besides Hamas Surrder - No.   
Using lies doesn't help the Palestinian cause; on the opposite, it takes them back and shows the absurdity of supporting their side.

It doesn\'t matter if they eat babies for breakfast and fry puppies for lunch; they\'re still not terrorists. Conversely, Hamas members who do not wear identifying markers are terrorists. It doesn\'t matter if they only target kitten-murdering pedophiles who talk in movie theaters, they\'re still terrorists.\n\n""Terrorist"" does not mean any illegitimate combatant. It has a very specific meaning, like any other legal term.', 'The two concepts overlap.  There are two main definitions of terrorism: \n\n1) The use of violence short of war against civilian targets to change political opinion.\n\n2) Violent actions by militias not in control of specific territory (i.e. not a government or guerrilla organization) as a means of exerting political pressure.\n\nFreedom fighter: a person who takes part in a resistance movement against an oppressive political or social establishment.\n\nHamas in the West Bank meets all 3 definitions.', ""So here's my perspective: if you're fighting for a political cause and you are targeting soldiers, police, and government officials, you're a freedom fighter or an insurgent (depending on whether you sympathize with the rebels or the government, basically).\n\nHowever, if you're fighting for the same cause and you're targeting civilians, bystanders, etc... you're a terrorist. That applies to everyone, regardless of whether you sympathize with their cause."", 'If Palestinian terrorists were fighting for freedom, there might be a case for discussion.\n\nFar as I can see they‚Äôre fighting to end non-belligerent occupation to enable Islamist dictatorship.']"
IsraelPalestine,Why can't Pro-Palestine people admit that Hamas are terrorists?,Discussion,02/11/2023 12:00:59,"The Oxford dictionary defines terrorism as: 

The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

By definition, Hamas are terrorists. 

From my discussions with Pro-Palestine people, many deny that Hamas are terrorists. 

Their reasoning is Hamas's terrorism against Isreal is justified, and therefore they aren't terrorists, they are 'freedom fighters'. 

This is extremely problematic, because all terrorism is politically motivated, and the terrorists always believe their violence is 'justified'. 

Pro-Palestine people will then accuse the IDF or Zionists of being terrorists for their violence and intimidation towards the Palestinians.  OK, if that makes them terrorists, why aren't Hamas also terrorists for doing the same thing? 

You can argue back and forth about who started it, but BOTH Hamas and the IDF are terrorising civilians and Hamas are also terrorising their own civilians by executing them, provoking Isreal and then using the Palestinians as human shields. 

If you are Pro-Palestine, you should be against Hamas. Hamas had a chance to make Palestine at better place after Isreal ended their occupation, to choose the path of peace, but they chose war and corruption.

They pro-Palestinians (I\'d say more likely BDSers here I think you are being overly broad) believe ""terrorist"" is a negative word, and they fully associate the random  slaughter of Jewish kids at a dance as a positive event and so reject the word on emotional grounds.  \n\n> If you are Pro-Palestine, you should be against Hamas. Hamas had a chance to make Palestine at better place after Isreal ended their occupation, to choose the path of peace, but they chose war and corruption.\n\nSorry totally disagree with you. ""Pro-Palestinians"" have a long track record of not caring about Palestinians at all when Jews aren\'t involved.  Lebanon for example has horrific discrimination against ethnically Palestinian Lebanese.  BDS generally favor the policy.  We are going to here all day about the IDF bombing of a refugee camp.  When ISIS was tearing up the largest Palestinian refugee camp in the world, BDS were completely indifferent (and BTW don\'t let them play the ""nothing we can do"" they ignorant it was even happening even though supposedly their hatred of Israel is based on deep concern for Palestinians: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarmouk_Camp#During_the_Syrian_Civil_War). \n\nThe reality is these guys detest Jews.  Hamas has similar attitudes towards Jews: no peace, nothing but never ending hostility till the end of time.

I am really saddened by this war, and the people caught in the crossfire because of Hamas' abhorrent evil actions. 

Like, my understanding is that the West Bank is fairly peaceful and safe, could they find a way to get the non-Hamas supporters relocated over there? And then with only Hamas and their allies left, the Israeli army can just go full hammer until they're all gone.

I sadly don't see any other way to solve this, aside from getting Hamas completely out of the picture, permanently.","['If there was a way, the IDF would have done it.\n\nUnfortunately, there is support for Hamas in a lot of Gazans household - we see that in videos of dead/unconscious Israelis being paraded in the streets of Gaza and being spat at and cheered.\n\nAlso, there are testimonies from ex-Gazans, the famous one is Dor Shahar (previously  Ayman Soubach) who has lived in Gaza and converted to Judaism.
