IsraelPalestine,"Hamas is a TERRORIST org like ISIS, Al Qaeda or Taliban",,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"People are forgetting that Hamas is as much a terrorist organization as ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Taliban

Hamas has actively killed any political rivals such as Fatah as they are not Islamic enough. This is what the Taliban and Daesh do, kill any peaceful political Muslim rival parties and use Fascism to get into and maintain power under the guise of religion. 

This is a catastrophic shortsighted blunder by Hamas, not only are they descending upon Israelis like ISIS style Jihadis, the whole world will see the obvious terror outfit this organization is. Muslims will make themselves more liable by siding with Hamas as they lack the nuance to see Palestine without a terrorist organization like Hamas being it's representative.

Most are too politically naive to realize that you don't poke a bear you can't fight. These guys have a few rockets and Iran backing them for their own nefarious political gains, that don't even align with the Palestinians long term safety in mind. You really think you can yell Allahu Akbar and take on the Israeli or US militaries. Do you want them to carpet bomb you? Hamas is being as suicidal and as unplanned as you'd expect from typical inbred Jihadis. 

This has never been a simple battle between Palestine and Israel. Israel is a strategic country, almost like a forward operating Base and it's existence will be maintained no matter what by western nations for their control in the middle east. Are Muslims this politically naive? Look at social media right now 

You don't mess with Nuclear armed nations. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened barely 70 years ago.

Edit: For reference I'm an ex Muslim from Pakistan who grew up supporting Palestine his whole life only to realize that Hamas and Palestine is just a front for Jihadis","['Hamas definitely not winning any hearts and minds around the world with their level of indiscriminate, barbaric savagery against innocent Israeli civilians including women, children, and the elderly, but also foreign nationals. 🤦💩💩', 'No videos of Israelis launching rockets at Gaza shouting ""god is great!"" while women and children die. Keep in mind, one side goes through great lengths to protect their women and children through the Iron Dome from wanton aggression. The other side hides their combatants behind their women and children, and that tells you almost everything you need to know.', ""That's why we all feel like we are taking crazy pills! The goal of Hamas is to massacre Jews not establish a thriving Palestine state! Hamas and Hezbollah serve the interest of Iran."", 'Yes!

Israel held not an acre of what is now considered disputed territory. And yet we enjoyed no peace.  \nYear after year Israel called for pleaded for — a negotiated peace with the Arab governments. Their answer was a blank refusal and more war... The reason was not a conflict over territorial claims. The reason was, and remains, the fact that a free Jewish state sits on territory at all.""  \nYitzhak Rabin', 'I think it goes without saying that Hamas and Palestine are not the same thing. however, my understanding is Hamas was the “elected” (I don’t know the circumstances of how that happened) government of Palestine and for the most part, no one speaks out against them. \nThat all being said, I don’t see how anyone comes away from what just occurred in Gaza as a success or anything to be cheered, it’s one thing to “fight the power” and be the rebels to the western empire, it’s another to target fully civilian populations and murder indiscriminately (thinking mainly about the music festival). It doesn’t help that some groups immediately jumped to “Israel started it” rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don’t understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. \nI sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas’ shoulders. I just wish I saw more Palestinian voices speaking out and decrying what took place/ condemning Hamas. Entirely possible I just haven’t seen those voices. \n\nFull Disclosure: this is my raw opinion on the matter, only got up to speed today on everything going on. I’m not saying this is 100% correct so if you have anything to add or correct, please feel free.', 'regardless of who you ""support,"" the terrorists have committed heinous acts. If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn\'t listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace.', 'The Palestinian supporters on my social media are saying “Israelis don’t care about their hostages because they are bombing Gaza (with a Hamas fighter here or there). Israel just wants destruction.” I was flabbergasted when I read that. First by saying so casually a Hamas fighter here or there bc Hamas actually did bomb a Gaza hospital so that’s their justification. And second, I promise as a non Palestinian Muslim woman posting that, if you were there in the country you would NOT be spared by Hamas even if you shared their religion. The supporters are protesting while going back to their comfy homes in the States not even comprehending that if Hamas was in the States, even if you supported their country for “resisting against oppression”, they would literally not spare you.', 'Hamas is aided by Iran .']"
IsraelPalestine,Is IDF a terrorist group?,,17/11/2023 09:46:32,"Another funny claim by Muhammed Hijab is that IDF is a terrorist group because they killed X amount of people.   
This needs to include the basics of our law systems and basic logic.   
Let's start with a basic example: 

1. One person woke up to find an intruder in his home aiming a gun at his wife, he shot and killed the intruder.
2. Someone goes to a shop for a robbery and, in the process, murders the shop owner.   


Are they both having the same responsibility? Are they both murderers? Of course not!   
What does Oxford say about terrorism?

>The calculated use of violence or threat of violence to inculcate fear. Terrorism is intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological.

* Does Hamas try to intimidate Israelis? Yes
* Are Hamas's goals political and religious? Yes
* Which group tries to maximize deaths, Israel or Hamas? Hamas
* Which group killed 20x more people per hour? Hamas
* Now, is Israel trying to Intimidate Palestinians? No, it tries to help them to escape. 
* Does Israel have any political goal? Besides Hamas Surrder - No.   
Using lies doesn't help the Palestinian cause; on the opposite, it takes them back and shows the absurdity of supporting their side.

IsraelPalestine,Why can't Pro-Palestine people admit that Hamas are terrorists?,Discussion,02/11/2023 12:00:59,"The Oxford dictionary defines terrorism as: 

The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

By definition, Hamas are terrorists. 

From my discussions with Pro-Palestine people, many deny that Hamas are terrorists. 

Their reasoning is Hamas's terrorism against Isreal is justified, and therefore they aren't terrorists, they are 'freedom fighters'. 

This is extremely problematic, because all terrorism is politically motivated, and the terrorists always believe their violence is 'justified'. 

Pro-Palestine people will then accuse the IDF or Zionists of being terrorists for their violence and intimidation towards the Palestinians.  OK, if that makes them terrorists, why aren't Hamas also terrorists for doing the same thing? 

You can argue back and forth about who started it, but BOTH Hamas and the IDF are terrorising civilians and Hamas are also terrorising their own civilians by executing them, provoking Isreal and then using the Palestinians as human shields. 

If you are Pro-Palestine, you should be against Hamas. Hamas had a chance to make Palestine at better place after Isreal ended their occupation, to choose the path of peace, but they chose war and corruption.

Lebanon for example has horrific discrimination against ethnically Palestinian Lebanese.  BDS generally favor the policy.  We are going to here all day about the IDF bombing of a refugee camp.

I am really saddened by this war, and the people caught in the crossfire because of Hamas' abhorrent evil actions. 

Like, my understanding is that the West Bank is fairly peaceful and safe, could they find a way to get the non-Hamas supporters relocated over there? And then with only Hamas and their allies left, the Israeli army can just go full hammer until they're all gone.

IsraelPalestine,Is the IDF a terrorist organization?,,24/11/2023 15:22:38,"The definition of terrorism is “a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims”.

They kill kids who throw rocks. Not to mention the peaceful protest in Gaza in 2021 where the idf killed about 200 protestors who had no guns. Doesn’t this make the idf a terrorist organization?

As for Hamas, they commit violence, but under international law they have the right to resist the occupation by any means necessary. Killing civilians is wrong on both sides but the IDF appears to be worse than Hamas. Also there is no evidence for a lot of what Hamas is accused for on Oct.7 like rape and be heading.
