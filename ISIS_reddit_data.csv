IsraelPalestine,"Hamas is a TERRORIST org like ISIS, Al Qaeda or Taliban",,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"People are forgetting that Hamas is as much a terrorist organization as ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Taliban

Hamas has actively killed any political rivals such as Fatah as they are not Islamic enough. This is what the Taliban and Daesh do, kill any peaceful political Muslim rival parties and use Fascism to get into and maintain power under the guise of religion. 

This is a catastrophic shortsighted blunder by Hamas, not only are they descending upon Israelis like ISIS style Jihadis, the whole world will see the obvious terror outfit this organization is. Muslims will make themselves more liable by siding with Hamas as they lack the nuance to see Palestine without a terrorist organization like Hamas being it's representative.

Most are too politically naive to realize that you don't poke a bear you can't fight. These guys have a few rockets and Iran backing them for their own nefarious political gains, that don't even align with the Palestinians long term safety in mind. You really think you can yell Allahu Akbar and take on the Israeli or US militaries. Do you want them to carpet bomb you? Hamas is being as suicidal and as unplanned as you'd expect from typical inbred Jihadis. 

This has never been a simple battle between Palestine and Israel. Israel is a strategic country, almost like a forward operating Base and it's existence will be maintained no matter what by western nations for their control in the middle east. Are Muslims this politically naive? Look at social media right now 

You don't mess with Nuclear armed nations. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened barely 70 years ago.

Edit: For reference I'm an ex Muslim from Pakistan who grew up supporting Palestine his whole life only to realize that Hamas and Palestine is just a front for Jihadis","['Hamas definitely not winning any hearts and minds around the world with their level of indiscriminate, barbaric savagery against innocent Israeli civilians including women, children, and the elderly, but also foreign nationals. 🤦💩💩', 'No videos of Israelis launching rockets at Gaza shouting ""god is great!"" while women and children die. Keep in mind, one side goes through great lengths to protect their women and children through the Iron Dome from wanton aggression. The other side hides their combatants behind their women and children, and that tells you almost everything you need to know.', ""That's why we all feel like we are taking crazy pills! The goal of Hamas is to massacre Jews not establish a thriving Palestine state! Hamas and Hezbollah serve the interest of Iran."", 'Yes!

Their answer was a blank refusal and more war... The reason was not a conflict over territorial claims. The reason was, and remains, the fact that a free Jewish state sits on territory at all.""  \nYitzhak Rabin', 'I think it goes without saying that Hamas and Palestine are not the same thing. however, my understanding is Hamas was the “elected” (I don’t know the circumstances of how that happened) government of Palestine and for the most part, no one speaks out against them. \nThat all being said, I don’t see how anyone comes away from what just occurred in Gaza as a success or anything to be cheered, it’s one thing to “fight the power” and be the rebels to the western empire, it’s another to target fully civilian populations and murder indiscriminately (thinking mainly about the music festival). It doesn’t help that some groups immediately jumped to “Israel started it” rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don’t understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. \nI sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas’ shoulders. I just wish I saw more Palestinian voices speaking out and decrying what took place/ condemning Hamas. Entirely possible I just haven’t seen those voices. \n\nFull Disclosure: this is my raw opinion on the matter, only got up to speed today on everything going on. I’m not saying this is 100% correct so if you have anything to add or correct, please feel free.', 'regardless of who you ""support,"" the terrorists have committed heinous acts. If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn\'t listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace.', 'The Palestinian supporters on my social media are saying “Israelis don’t care about their hostages because they are bombing Gaza (with a Hamas fighter here or there). Israel just wants destruction.” I was flabbergasted when I read that. First by saying so casually a Hamas fighter here or there bc Hamas actually did bomb a Gaza hospital so that’s their justification. And second, I promise as a non Palestinian Muslim woman posting that, if you were there in the country you would NOT be spared by Hamas even if you shared their religion. The supporters are protesting while going back to their comfy homes in the States not even comprehending that if Hamas was in the States, even if you supported their country for “resisting against oppression”, they would literally not spare you.', 'Hamas is aided by Iran .']"
IsraelPalestine,HAMAS is ISIS,,04/11/2023 22:59:13,"I live in Israel 🇮🇱 and support Israel 🇮🇱.
This post is directed to anyone supporting Hamas.

Everyday I see the list of names of the fallen Israeli soldiers.

All of them are 19, 20, 21 years old. They didn't have time to go on the big trip, study, start families.
They risked everything to protect us Israelis.

And right here on this very app I'm seeing all these posts and comments, you young people standing in a pro-Palestinian demonstration.

You're probably about 20 years old. you demonstrate such passion, such self-importance towards Hamas, a cancer that mutilates civilians, that destorys and kills the basic humanity in life. you feel like heroes, and after posting you're shit here you're gonna euphorically drink your Starbucks.

And I envy you so much that you'll never know what heroes look like. Real, 19 to 21 years old who lost their lives in battle to protect their family and friends.
you'll never know what it's like seeing you loved ones getting kidnapped to god knows where.
you'll never know what it's like to get bombed and shot for your very existence.

it's so easy here on the keyboard to spread this hatred and terrorism.

you won't last a day in with Hamas because they don't value life, they don't value the western values you grew up on.
By supporting Hamas you support the killing of jews and Christians alike, you support LGBT punishable by death or life sentence, you support no rights for women.
And it's all so easy on the internet.

I can't understand you guys

how can you support people that want to kill us,not out of spite and resentment,well 
not anymore at least but
because it is a part of their agenda,their beliefs that Israel and Jews should be dead.
Palestinians don't really want to establish a Palestinian state,they had 15 years to do that and they blew it,
15 long years to establish an autonomous,prosperous state and what did they choose to all this time? stir up conflicts with Israel. 

Now I'm aware that they want all
of ""Historic Palestine"" as a state (Historic
Palestine is bullshit by the way stop being fools and actually believing such entity existed🤣🤣🤣) or nothing but, 
Why not start with Gaza and the West Bank and go on from there? You guys will get your genocidal utopia in the end but at least
start with something,what do you guys think?
They said a big fat NOOO and chose to continue with their campaign,noble but stupid in my opinion.

So why the Palestinian State doesn't exist?
Because it's not the endgame
I'll let you in a little secret,the destruction of Israel is
And don't start with ""buuuuttttt they were here before uhhhh"" no they didn't,there is PLENTY of evidence out there that shows the opposite,the Jews were there first and we are here to STAY!!
You know what? even if they were here before,they fought with Israel SIX times and lost every time.
Don't you think it's time to admit defeat and move on?

Also,lsrael proposed to the Palestinians SEVEN times offers to establish a Palestinian state with the help of Israel and they said a big fat NO0O every.single.time
In Hamas' Charter it is explicitly said that their goal is to destroy Israel by any means nessecary,that means that Terror,Murder,Bombings,Meat
Shields,Rape,Mutilation,Torture is game
For Hamas,every way to destabilise and destroy Israel is
game,horrendous,atrocius,inhumane,monstrous.
Everything goes


The world must remember the October 7th massace,how
Hamas MURDERED 1,400 civilians(among them lsraeli Arabs and Palestinians,yes yes they weren't spared
because Hamas doesn't give a sh*t who they're shooting at)
KIDNAPPED AND RAPED 240 Israelis and MUTILATED pregnant women
And you guys support that?

IsraelPalestine,"Hamas, Al-Quaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, etc worship death rather than celebrating life.",,25/11/2023 12:14:02,"Let’s ignore October 7th and go back to 9/11. The day following the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, CBS (I think it was) showed a clip of Palestinian women dancing in the streets after hearing of the deaths of 2,700-odd Americans in New York, after terrorist attacks. I have a sneaking suspicion that that video was pulled soon after, since I never saw it again, and the subject matter was never mentioned. But that was enough for me. I have been anti-Palestine and pro-Israel ever since, because I have no sympathy for anyone, of any country, who would gleefully celebrate the deaths of over 2,700 innocent victims. It takes a very special kind of evil, disgusting, warped and inhumane mind to behave like that. 

Were 9/11 terrorists also “freedom fighters” or “resistance fighters”? Fighting the occupation? 

Now back to October 7th, watching hundreds of Palestinians laughing, dancing and celebrating in the streets after the Hamas atrocities, I stopped having sympathy for them, how about you?

[Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-bright-line-between-good-and-evil) very eloquently put it “Israel’s behavior is not what explains the suicidal and genocidal inclinations of a group like Hamas. The Islamic doctrines of MARTYRDOM and JIHAD do.”","['This conflict will change things throughout the world, prior to the 7th I would have had some sympathy for Palestinian ppl, now I have absolutely zero', ""It's a death cult\n\nAnd now, millions of Europeans and North Americans have signed on \n\nSort of like if Jonestown had 10 million citizens"", 'https://preview.redd.it/zk1msnew2i2c1.jpeg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae6432b65049b43dc21108669db4948d344bb6ac', '[removed]', ""I am saying this as someone who was born in Palestine, grew up in both Palestine and Jordan, a Muslim who studied in a Christian school, lived and worked in the US and Europe for more than 5 years collectively.\n\nFirst of all, I firmly believe that all ethnicities, religions, movements, nations, you name it. The majority (> 95%) of the people who belong to it, are just normal people who are just trying to move through life by getting the sense of belonging to something, a compass for their actions, and a community. While the rest are extremists who are ruining it for everyone because usually they are the loudest.\n\nFor the Palestinian woman dancing, there is on the opposite side Israelis grabbing popcorn and watching Israel bombing Gaza. For the Palestinians dancing on October 7th, some Israelis were making tiktoks and reels mocking Gazans who do not have water or electricity. There are bad apples on all sides.\n\nAlso, all people are impulsive and dont take the whole context when they are reacting to something. A funny example I can think of, at the start of Covid, it was reported that in NY, Uber drivers were rejecting the requests of Asian people haha. \n\nThe US is a great great country IMO, I think it has a very good influence on the world in general. But, during this process, they have made many lives miserable as well, and they will for sure gain so many haters, and rightfully so tbh. They have staged coups all over the world, started or participated in so many wars.\n\nDeath is not celebrated in the Islamic concept at all, and the life of humans is sacred as in any other religion, they just have a different perspective of dying in pursuit of defending your country, or in war. The same in the US, almost every event I attended, there was some kind of appreciation or celebration to the veterans, do the US people worship wars? No, they just have a great perspective of someone risking and dedicating their lives for their country and people, and I am not American, but I got goosebumps every time I saw this. Everything goes both ways in so many beliefs and cultures.\n\nNow, the 9/11 attacks are horrible, by all means. And there is no way on earth that you could justify or defend that. But for the Palestinian woman, who most probably did not think through when she danced, for her the US is part of why Israel has been able to build settlements in the West bank (it is not important for her if it is legal or not), she might have been kicked out of her home because of that, she knows a lot of people who were killed because of that or the whole conflict. She was happy when the US was harmed.\n\nIf you ask an Iraqi mother now about the US, who might have lost her children in the war, she might be happy if an earthquake occurred in the US.\n\nSome US citizens were celebrating the Trump Muslim ban, a lot of US citizens in the 40's and 50's said the Nuclear bombs were a very good idea, because they have lost relatives and friends in pearl harbor.\n\nWe are really really complicated humans, most of us want to just live in peace, and have a decent life, and we are also weak, so when who we thought are our enemies get attacked, we get the sense that we got a little bit of a revenge, someone got the revenge of my dead son, my dead friend.

That call, for an intifada, or ""uprising"" to happen within Palestinian terroitories and against Israel has in actuality brought about a parallel process here in western states. An intifada of sorts has metasticised within liberal western capitals, and in many ways thats the point. \n\n\n\nIn no other place outside of the Western orbit exists dissident populations of such opposing cultural and political view, indeed not only do they not exist but they could not exist. It is inconceivable that in Tehran there could be a population of up to 40% of white westerners and other non Iranians who week after week clogged the streets to call for uprising against for example Bashar Al-Assads barrel bombing of his own people. There would be mass murder and detention, there would have been ethnic cleansing prior to that even, or before any of these potential eventualities there would have been a crack down on immigration in the first place. To bring this hypothetical parallel potential to its full conclusion, there would in the first place never have been ANY migration into Iran or any other non western illiberal state in the first place. Why? Well because Western nations with western values and western technology producing western oppertunity and western refuge are what migrants seek. \n\n\n\n\xa0This is a trap the West broadly finds itself in. Large populations which do not support its interests enabled by those same interests to be where they are in the first place. Put simply, liberal western values and the successes\xa0 which that has created(hijacked by cultural Marxism) has incubated the conditions into which outside populations enter who in many cases oppose those exact values which facilitated their entry in the first place. \n\n\n\nWe then see harrasment of Jewish citizens of France, Britain and other European countries by a strange mix of Marxists and Islamists. Those calls for intifada are not just a call for some struggle in a far off place, but actually an unconscious call for a usurpation in Western countries by those of cultural Marxist bent, in collution with immigrant populations and their descendants who rather than appreciate or value the West which nurtures them, hate and revile it.\n\nFrom my blog about Western Civilisation at a crossroads.\n\n\nhttps://eoinocnaimhsi.wixsite.com/fabulanostra/post/inter-fada']"

IsraelPalestine,Explaining how to calculate the body count,,26/10/2023 09:35:19,"I figured there's a lot of people spending a lot of time trying to work out if eradicating Hamas is worth however many people the ISIS Ministry of Health in Gaza has said have already died.

To that end, I make a scientific contribution, based on known past facts and extrapolations of data.

1. According to the ISIS Ministry of Health, [700 Palestinians died overnight two nights ago](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/more-than-700-killed-in-overnight-israeli-attacks-gaza-officials-say) in 400 Israeli air raids. I have linked to Al Jazeera as it is an ISIS-friendly news source and would never lie.
2. According to the Palestinian Authority represented by one, Ahmed Abdel Rahman who held the post of Secretary-General of the PA, in 2002 Israel killed ""[thousands](https://www.upi.com/Archives/2002/04/12/Palestinians-Thousands-in-mass-graves/5171018584000/)"" in the Battle of Jenin. You will note that the Palestinian Authority would never ever lie about these things.

Obviously the above are authoritative statements and speak to the amazing efficiency of Palestinian leaders, whether ISIS or ISIS-lite, in counting dead Arabs.

In contrast I bring our Western first world nations where a [collapsed building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_condominium_collapse) in Surfside, Florida - a single non-bombed building, might I add... it took 4 days to confirm 10 dead. The total number of dead ended up being 98 and the final confirmation came 32 days after the event.

The fact that the ISIS Ministry of Health was able to identify 700 dead Arabs by pulling 700 bodies out of the rubble of collapsed buildings (one presumes 400 such buildings) in a 12hr overnight period speaks to their efficiency, attention to detail and rigorous scientific approach. Very impressive.

You know what makes it even more impressive? They managed to sift through the rubble of (presumably) 400 bombed buildings IN THE DARK overnight, because obviously there's no fuel for the power station or any other equipment to light up the rubble for emergency workers to work in.

Impressive? Nay. Astonishing. The Palestinians and their natural night vision are the next stage of human evolution, clearly.

Now with respect to the Battle of Jenin, where many ""thousands"" (I presume that ""many"" means at least ""two"" of these ""thousands"") were killed, it turns out that the sneaky Jews hid all but 53 of the bodies. This is very important - remember that ISIS and ISIS-Lite would never ever lie or try to elevate the numbers of dead Arabs in the knowledge that there are sycophantic and completely brainless zombies in the West who actually believe them, and not just believe them, but actively deny any questioning of ISIS and ISIS-Lite whose authority on such matters is unparalleled (see points 1 and 2 above).

I call this the ""Jenin Multiplier"" - where only a fortieth of those killed will be found, with the pesky Zionists having stolen all the other bodies.

2 days ago we were at ""over 5000"" dead according to the ISIS Ministry of Health, and Al Jazeera. I presume that today we're at ""over 6000"".

Based on the ""Jenin Multiplier"" of 40x, we will find only 150 dead in Gaza. Of these 150 dead Palestinians, 471 would have been killed by the PIJ rocket attack on Al-Ahli hospital, which holds the all-Middle-East record for number of Arabs killed in one strike. Congratulations to PIJ on that achievement.

In any case, with the above documented and rigorous scientific process, I conclude that the number of dead Palestinians is somewhat north of 150 people and quite a bit south of 6000. All other bodies have been hidden by the Zionists and will never be found.

*However* based on the 150 minimum and the fact that PIJ claims 471 dead of these, it is not impossible that the death toll is currently -321.

I think that after 9/11, our society became extremely racist towards Muslims and after several years, the Islamophobia movement came about, which was great because it did really combat racism towards Muslims. However, we've now gone so far in that direction as a society, we're no longer critically analyzing situations. We're now just saying let's not be Islamophobic so Israel must be bad because they're all white.

IsraelPalestine,"Asking why Palestinian society does not oppose terrorism on Israelis, is not a right wing stance",Opinion,07/09/2022 20:14:40,"There have been way too many [polls](https://www.timesofisrael.com/most-young-palestinians-support-attacks-on-israelis-poll/) about this for anyone to deny the fact that not only do many Palestinians not condemn terrorism on Israelis, but actually support it.

The reason this should be reversed is simple: Terrorism from Palestinian groups, incite and warrant an Israeli response. And those same Palestinian groups do not have camps and HQs out in the desert, they have them inside civilian areas. Most attacks that can be carried out against those military targets will inevitably cause civilian casualties.

Palestinians and their supporters do not want Israel to strike the terrorists because that causes civilian casualties, but what other options does Israel have? Have its citizens killed without retaliating?

I have seen PERSONALLY people in real life that I know support Palestine, retweeting and liking tweets that praised the ISIS attacks on Israeli civilians last March. In fact, people accused Israel of ""trying to paint the resistance as terrorism by linking the attackers to ISIS"" when the Israeli media was talking about rumors of the attackers being ISIS members. This is all until ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks because then you're not just promoting terrorism against Israelis but you're also threatening Arab govts. And only then, did people stop that mess of terrorism apologia and cheering.

&#x200B;

There is a simple solution to this problem. Palestinians standing against terrorism and those terrorist groups that represent the Palestinian front. Asking this, is not a right wing stance. This is the only way to transcend this conflict and status quo, before it's irreversibly a fight between Islamist terrorists and radical right wingers in which each sides will keep blaming the other for their civilian deaths.","['Palestinians celebrate every terrorist attack against Israelis by dancing and throwing candy at children.

IsraelPalestine,why is the left is that delusional,Serious,15/10/2023 08:41:55,"the reason Israel was founded was so there would be a country that would take the Jews and there would be somewhere to go in case of something like the events in WW2.

now when we see some leftist say  why do the Jews need their own state they stole land and so on  meanwhile in Germany they  marking the houses of Jews (1930's anybody?) in Australia people chanting ""gas the Jews"" in France synagogues going into lock down and all over the west universities students and leftists chant ""from the river to the sea"" meaning kill all the Jews in Israel.

ICC Statute Pursuant to Article 8(2)(b)(xxiii) of the 1998 ICC Statute, “utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts

Article 28 - Treatment II. Danger zones

The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, **(meaning if the use of human shields is a war crime)**

Article 29 - Treatment III. Responsibilities

The Party to the conflict in whose hands protected persons may be, is responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents, irrespective of any individual responsibility which may be incurred **(if you do something that would get your civilians in danger if they are killed the other side didn't commit a war crime you did)**

Article 23 - Security of prisoners

No prisoner of war may at any time be sent to, or detained in areas where he may be exposed to the fire of the combat zone, nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.Prisoners of war shall have shelters against air bombardment and other hazards of war, to the same extent as the local civilian population. With the exception of those engaged in the protection of their quarters against the aforesaid hazards, they may enter such shelters as soon as possible after the giving of the alarm. Any other protective measure taken in favour of the population shall also apply to them.Detaining Powers shall give the Powers concerned, through the intermediary of the Protecting Powers, all useful information regarding the geographical location of prisoner of war camps.Whenever military considerations permit, prisoner of war camps shall be indicated in the day-time by the letters PW or PG, placed so as to be clearly visible from the air. The Powers concerned may, however, agree upon any other system of marking. Only prisoner of war camps shall be marked as such.

Article 53 - Prohibited destruction

Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. **(meaning if you make a civil property  a weapon depot its fair game)**

Article 51 - Protection of the civilian population

1 the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against dangers   arising from military operations. To give effect to this protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable rules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.

2 The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited. **(Hamas attack anybody)**

4 Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are:

(a) those which are not directed at a specific military objective; **(if its a weapon depot its not indiscriminate)**

7 The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favor or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations. **(Really try justify Hamas here)**

Fact is, Israel exists and unless you plan go carry out a genocide of 8 million people, this isn't changing.

How should Israel have reacted to the October 7th massacres?

When 9/11 happened, the US army flew halfway across the world and wrecked havoc, killed FAR more civilians than Israel ever did in Gaza.

When ISIS begun threatening the western world, executing citizens from different western nations and attacking western allies in the middle east, the west formed a coalition and sent troops halfway across the world to fight ISIS, killing many civilians in the process. 


How should Israel react to an organization that raided and slaughtered, raped, burnt and mutilated around 1400 people, mainly civilians including babies and the elderly, kidnapped around 240 people, and publicly says they plan to do it again, and isn't located halfway across the world, but a 30 minutes drive away from the southern cities which they already massacred?

They didn’t expect it. \n\nWatching on TV a London protest, one young woman explained:\n\n“Israel is killing Palestinians. They killed Palestinians in 2014 and in 2018. ONE TIME the Palestinians responded and are been called terrorists! That’s not fair”…\n\nFrom this short view, one can understand the ignorance coupled with profound stupidity! They honestly believed Israel will not respond or even forget about the 10/7 massacre!\n\nEdit: another explanation is: Hamas does not represent the Palestinians . They were elected in 2005 with a slim margin. Since then there were no elections and many Palestinians were not born yet at that time. Conclusion: Hamas and the Palestinians from Gaza are two separate and unrelated entities. So there’s no reason for Israel to attack. Case closed! Again, delusional thinking plus serious stupidity result to weird conclusions.', 'Imagine if Mexico invaded Texas and murdered 1,500 Texans. The whole world would watch and clap as the US military marches down to Mexico City and eliminates every last military installation within their borders. \n\nThey just don’t believe that Israel has a right to exist or defend themselves. Israel is too small and irrelevant, so people act as if they’ve lost their right to sovereignty and to protect themselves.', 'I don’t think you’re asking the right question. \n\n‘what could we have done to stop the 7th happening in the first place?’ \nIs more important if we want to look for real change. \n\nHonestly given the political powers of Israel right now; the response given was predictable. But so was the 7th attack.\n\nIn a better world, the politicians who let it happen would take accountability for bad/0 intel,   Slow response times and letting it get so bad and should step down. \n\nIn my opinion a more measured and tactical response would then be necessary, one which doesn’t indiscriminately bomb apartment blocks and target human shields just because they are being used as human shields. \n\nThis would not only get a more positive global support to the cause but also help curb the rise in antisemitism and paint Israel as the good guy and not the overpowered nation sticking it to the little guy.', ""Puting the fundamental muslim propaganda a side (kill & cry), in the middle east, if you ignore a provocation such as 7 october, you're dead since it's a clear sign for a weakness. At that point, no fundamental muslim enemy would stop slaughter you, since your weakness is an indication for a victory. So there is an amount of blood and lands you should charge him back, unless he'll strive for your total destruction. Therefore, Israel's react was driven by pure logic. The only part which is not expected is the respond of the western progressives which don't understand that. And fundamental muslims use this vulnerable point against the west as long as it's useable."", 'If you’re going to use the War on Terror as a whataboutism, you should know that the very same people who are opposed to the Israeli reaction are almost certainly opposed to the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Nobody on the left really supports those wars, and even right wing American figures such as Trump have labeled the Iraq war as a complete mistake. \n\nThe same goes for the intervention in the ISIS conflict. Maybe you don’t remember, but Barack Obama gave a televised announcement where he basically prepped the public for a boots on the ground intervention in Syria. The public responded with a collective “fuck no” so Obama settled for an air campaign  and a no-fly zone instead, with relatively minor land based operations. \n\nSo, you’re a looking for an inconsistency in the anti-Israeli side which simply isn’t there. You’re going to find very few people who think that Iraq/Afghanistan were justified, but Gaza wasn’t. \n\nThe reaction to October 7th should not have been indiscriminate bombing of densely packed civilian centers. If the IDF is the moral, elite force of claims to be, it should have been more than capable of a much cleaner operation than what we have seen so far. Either Israel is not the moral force it claims to be, or it’s not the elite force it claims to be, or both. Almost as many civilians have died in just a month of this conflict than have died during the nine years of the ISIS conflict. That’s simply an unacceptable reaction and just goes to show that Israel was far more interested in collectively punishing the entire population as a means of deterrence rather than using its supposedly elite intelligence and military forces to target Hamas specifically.', '9/11 resulted in the the rise of global terrorist movements and millions of muslims dead for something they didn’t do. \nAlmost everyone can agree that the war on terror made no sense and was utterly futile', 'There are a million posts here asking them that. 0 reasonable answers.

IsraelPalestine,"Debunking the trope ""Israel created Hamas""",Discussion,12/10/2023 13:07:22,"I've seen this breathtaking claim being made all across Reddit over the last few days, so I did a little research. The biggest source I found that makes this claim is [a video and article from The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/), a media outlet that has a left wing bias. If you watch the video and listen to the tone of the presenter, you can tell that he is almost gleeful in trying to make the point that anything that Hamas perpetrates against Israel is Israel's own doing.

But let's just follow the evidence they present, and see if it adds up to the claim they are making:

1) A quote from Yitzhak Segev, a former Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s, taken from a book called ""Arab and Jew: Wounded Spirits in a Promised Land"". In there (taken from Google Books search), I find this quote: ""...Segev once told me how he financed the Islamic movement as a counterweight to the PLO and the Communists. ""The Israeli government gave me a budget, and the military budget gives to the mosques"", he said. (That early funding helped nourish the seeds of Hamas and other Muslim movements that used terrorism to undermine the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.)""

2) A quote from Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades, in an article from 2009 in the Wall Street Journal. The quote is as follows: ""“Hamas, to my great regret, is Israel’s creation.""

Both those points seem pretty damning at first, but if you actually [read the WSJ article from 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20090926212507/http:/online.wsj.com/article/SB123275572295011847.html), you get a much deeper analysis of what happened, an analysis which does not support the conclusion being drawn by The Intercept.

I recommend reading the full article from WSJ, as it is very comprehensive and interesting. But I am going to quote some of the most relevant parts and highlight some relevant points:

> * The Palestinian cause was for decades l**ed
by the PLO**, which Israel regarded as a
**terrorist outfit** and sought to crush until the
1990s, when the PLO dropped its vow to
destroy the Jewish state.
* When Israel first encountered Islamists in Gaza in the 1970s and '80s, they seemed focused on
studying the Quran, **not on confrontation with Israel**. The Israeli government officially recognized
a precursor to Hamas called Mujama Al-Islamiya, registering the group as a charity. It allowed
Mujama members to set up an Islamic university and build mosques, clubs and schools.
Crucially, Israel often stood aside when the Islamists and their secular left-wing Palestinian rivals
battled, sometimes violently, for influence in both Gaza and the West Bank.
* When it became clear in the early 1990s that Gaza's Islamists had mutated from a religious
group into a fighting force aimed at Israel -- particularly after they turned to suicide bombings in
1994 -- **Israel cracked down** with ferocious force
* Mr. Segev says he had regular contact with Sheikh Yassin, in part to **keep an eye on him**. He
visited his mosque and met the cleric around a dozen times. It was illegal at the time for Israelis
to meet anyone from the PLO. Mr. Segev later arranged for the cleric to be taken to Israel for
hospital treatment. ""We had no problems with him,"" he says.
In fact, the cleric and Israel had a shared enemy: secular Palestinian activists. After a failed
attempt in Gaza to oust secularists from leadership of the Palestinian Red Crescent, the Muslim
version of the Red Cross, Mujama staged a violent demonstration, storming the Red Crescent
building. Islamists also attacked shops selling liquor and cinemas. The **Israeli military mostly
stood on the sidelines**.
Mr. Segev says the army didn't want to get involved in Palestinian quarrels but **did send soldiers**
to prevent Islamists from burning down the house of the Red Crescent's secular chief, a socialist
who supported the PLO
* Brig. Gen. Shalom
Harari, then a military intelligence officer in Gaza, says he received a call from Israeli soldiers
manning a checkpoint on the road out of Gaza. They had stopped a bus carrying Islamic
activists who wanted to join the battle against Fatah at Birzeit. ""I said: '**If they want to burn each
other let them go**,'"" recalls Mr. Harari.
A leader of Birzeit's Islamist faction at the time was Mahmoud Musleh, now a pro-Hamas
member of a Palestinian legislature elected in 2006. He recalls how usually aggressive Israeli
security forces **stood back and let conflagration develop**. He **denies any collusion** between his
own camp and the Israelis, but says ""they hoped we would become an alternative to the PLO.""
A year later, in 1984, the Israeli military received a tip-off from Fatah supporters that Sheikh
Yassin's Gaza Islamists were collecting arms, according to Israeli officials in Gaza at the time.
**Israeli troops raided a mosque and found a cache of weapons. Sheikh Yassin was jailed**. He told
Israeli interrogators the weapons were for use against rival Palestinians, not Israel, according to
Mr. Hacham, the military affairs expert who says he spoke frequently with jailed Islamists. **The
cleric was released after a year** and continued to expand Mujama's reach across Gaza.
* Mr. Harari, the military intelligence officer, says this and other warnings were ignored. But, he
says, t**he reason for this was neglect, not a desire to fortify the Islamists: ""Israel never financed
Hamas. Israel never armed Hamas**.""
Roni Shaked, a former officer of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, and author of a book
on Hamas, says Sheikh Yassin and his followers had a long-term perspective whose dangers
were not understood at the time. ""They worked slowly, slowly, step by step according to the
Muslim Brotherhood plan.""
* In 1987, several Palestinians were killed in a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver, triggering
a wave of protests that became known as the first Intifada, Mr. Yassin and six other Mujama
Islamists launched Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement. Hamas's charter, released a
year later, is studded with anti-Semitism and declares ""jihad its path and death for the cause of
Allah its most sublime belief.""
Israeli officials, **still focused on Fatah and initially unaware of the Hamas charter, continued to
maintain contacts with the Gaza Islamists**. Mr. Hacham, the military Arab affairs expert,
remembers taking one of Hamas's founders, Mahmoud Zahar, **to meet** Israel's then defense
minister, **Yitzhak Rabin**, as part of regular consultations between Israeli officials and Palestinians
not linked to the PLO. Mr. Zahar, the only Hamas founder known to be alive today, is now the
group's senior political leader in Gaza.
In 1989, Hamas carried out its first attack on Israel, abducting and killing two soldiers. Israel
**arrested Sheikh Yassin and sentenced him to life. It later rounded up more than 400 suspected
Hamas activists,** including Mr. Zahar, and deported them to southern Lebanon. There, they
hooked up with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed A-Team of anti-Israeli militancy.

I don't know how anyone can read this article and come to the conclusion ""Israel created Hamas"". It clearly lays out the Hamas was founded by Islamists who, **before creating Hamas**, were political rivals of the PLO, a terrorist group famous for high profile attacks such as Entebbe, Munich and Black September. The Islamists were at first a charitable and educational outfit (and Israel may have contributed some money to the mosques to facilitate aid and education in Gaza), and when they became militant they were fighting against the PLO, and not Israel. Israel kept an eye on the group fighting against their enemy, the PLO, and tolerated their existence, i.e. they did not interfere when they battled the PLO, but on occasion did in fact intervene when they went to far, and in fact jailed the leader Sheikh Yassin when he started to hoard weapons. A few years later Hamas was actually founded, and when they attacked Israel they immediately cracked down on them by arresting their leader, sentencing him to life, and deporting hundreds of their members to Lebanon. Both Israel and Hamas deny any collusion between the two.

There is no proof Israel ever armed Hamas, there is no proof Israel ever financed Hamas. There is evidence Israel tolerated the precursor group to Hamas, a group that had never attacked Israel, by standing aside and observing them, and intervening only occasionally. 

This claim has been twisted by people who want to show that anything that Hamas does to Israel is Israel simply reaping what they have sown. The truth is, Israel never gave any material support to Hamas. Hamas has been built up into what they are today by direct funding and supplies from the regime in Iran.","['Because they basically have to resort to blame somebody else, or conspiracy, because actually believing they’re responsible for their own actions would mean admitting they’re wrong.', 'Anytime pathways to peace were discussed between the Israelis and Palestinians the extremely began blowing people up.

This dynamic has continued into the present: In March 2019, Netanyahu told a meeting of his Likud party’s Knesset members that “anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas. This is part of our strategy—to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank,” Haaretz reported', 'I’ve seen this phrase all over Reddit today.

IsraelPalestine,"An Israeli combat medic vatern, want to share my story and my toughts",,11/11/2023 14:03:18,"Hi All,  
I'm an Israeli IDF vatern, and I want to share my story with you, the idea of sharing my story is to create conversation with people to make the conflict more clear and maybe we can start creating a solution by talking and not by fighting.  
  
When me and my friend were 17, each one of us had to decide what we'll do in the IDF, some of my friends went to the cyber units, some went to be combatants in different units in the IDF, and I was clueless, as a liberal, I didnt want to go to the army and kill people, neither Palestinians in Gaza or the West Bank, I also didnt believe in wars whatsoever so after a lot of toughts and hard decesions, I decided to go and become a combat medic, the idea was that Medics are more about saving lifes then taking them, and if I will get into a gun fight, there will always be other soldiers that will probably be able to handle the situation, worst case scenario, I will just kill myself and won't be an hostage.  
I always refused to kill anyone, I dont have it in me, I personally cant imagine taking the life of another human being, that was just sickening to think about, and I couldn't bare the consequences of doing so.  
  
So I started my journey in August 2014 in the Israeli army, got through tough times and finished the combat medic training with honors, a certain IDF commander came to me and said that due to my great skills I should become a commander that will train other combat medics in the future, I agreed, ofcourse, as I didnt want to kill no one, training the next generations of combat medics sounded like a great deal for me, I got tested, finished that test succesfully, but then, I had to go to go through the practical learning stage, I had to go and be a medic before I can actually teach it.  
  
December 2014, I was assigned to a special unit in the north, next to the Syrian border, quite close to Hezbollah militants, and what I learned about the IDF was quite shocking, I learned that in the Syrian border, Israeli troops goes every night to the Syrian borders and treat injured civilians and rebels against the Assad regime, as I was part of the unit that takes those wounded people to the Israeli hospitals in the north, I knew my future as a combat medic will not be trauma-free.  
  
The first one was a 5 years old kid, came with his mother (we wouldnt allow kids to come alone obviously), who had brain injury so severe, he died in our Ambulance on the way to the hospital, I want you to Imagine for a second, whats it like to be a fresh combat medic and having a 5 years old Syrian kid die in front of your eyes, his mother's reaction was so horrible I still have nightmares with her tearing eyes to this day, her 5 years old kid has died due to Assad's army bombing civilians and kids.  
  
I dont want to make it too long as its already a long post, but I treated over 200 wounded Syrians during my 6 mothes period in the border, one my team member got shot in the Syrian border after Assad's army ambushed us when trying to take wounded rebels to the hospitals.  
  
I've grown since then, got married and have a doughter that I love from the depth of my heart,  
I have three reason I'm writing this story down:  
1. To show you that the IDF are not monsters who seek to harm everyone  
2. To get to know more Palestinians who just want to talk and create a better future together.  
3. To show how the world is hypocrite by boycotting Israel's right to defend itself, while assad and Hezbollah kills civilians and childrens all the time.  
I feel sorry for palestinian people today, they are contolled by their own Assad = Hamas,  
Which makes them more misrable and creates a bad future for all of us.  
  
I really wish you all the best and thank you for reading this short story of my experience.

IsraelPalestine,A rant on behalf of the mediators.,,18/11/2023 21:57:13,"For those attempting the seemingly impossible task of holding multiple thoughts about complex issues at the same time:

To preface, I am not Jewish, Muslim, Palestinian, or Israeli. I am, however, invested in this conflict for reasons I'd rather keep private.  I've worked on human rights campaigns for Palestinian statehood and against antisemitism.  I and other colleagues and friends of mine with similarly complex views on this war have been called both zionists and jew haters, terrorist sympathizers and complicit in the genocide of Palestinians.  The rhetoric and rush to judgment around this conflict is at peak insanity, which is really saying something for a decades old conflict that seems to only bring out the worst in everyone.

It is possible to believe that both Israelis and Palestinians have legitimate claims to this land, that both the Israeli and Palestinian governments have committed grave injustices against one another, and regularly make decisions and use language that escalates tensions in the region, make peace less and less likely, and endanger their own people.

It is possible to both support Israel's right to defend itself and wage this war against Hamas and call for greater restraint and consideration for the humanitarian impact of bombarding civilian areas, and voice concern over how it will radicalize yet another generation of Palestinians to join militant islamist and *terrorist* organizations. It is possible to support Israel and abhor the Netanyahu government.

It is possible to both support the Palestinian struggle to overcome decades of occupation and mistreatment by Israel and stand firmly against Hamas.  They are not merely an ""armed resistance,"" and their tactics are illegitimate, barbaric, and cause deliberate and catastrophic harm to the people they claim to defend. There are no easy ways to defeat an enemy like Hamas.

It is possible to be skeptical of both the official Israeli government's and Hamas' narrative of this war.

It is also possible for those not directly involved in this conflict to not have a monomaniacal fixation on it at the expense of everything else going on in the world, one's personal relationships, and one's own mental health. This is the only geopolitical conflict in the world that seems to demand that everyone have an opinion on it. I'm beyond tired of the public pressure campaigns to pick sides and partake in cheap sloganeering. 

Not all of us have neatly defined allegiances and b/w views that can be easily unpacked without tons of context and caveats. I'm tired of the advocates of compassion, pragmatism, and suspended judgment being drowned out by the most extreme, ill-informed, and impulsive voices. We need more people who aren't singularly focused on proving others wrong.  We need more mediators.","[""Hey, Israeli here.  \nI can genuinely say I wish more people had your mindset.

(yes) - Isi Leibler](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.740152)





You are free to read through it above. I'm just going to post a few snippets bellow that make factual claims. 




> The Palestinian leaders have stated explicitly that their state would be Judenrein and that Jews would never be permitted to live in their ancestral home, even if they were willing to accept Palestinian jurisdiction Those deemed to have sold land to a Jew are brutally executed. Surely such behavior must be considered racist.

* Chief Negotiator Erekat: “If Netanyahu argues that these positions are against Jews, we say to him that two Jews were elected in 2009 as members of Fatah’s Revolutionary Council: Ilan Halevi and Uri Davis. Our position is against settlements, considering them illegal and contrary to all international laws.” and ""I hope the day will come when Israelis can live freely in the state of Palestine.""

* PLO Executive member Hanan Ashrawi: “Any person, be he Jewish, Christian or Buddhist, will have the right to apply for Palestinian citizenship. Our basic law prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity.”

* ex-Prime minister and Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qurei: “As for settlements, we proposed the following: Removal of some settlements, annexation of others, and keeping others under Palestinian sovereignty"" and “There are 30,000 people living in Ma’aleh Adumim. They can live under Palestinian rule,""

* ex-Prime Minister Salam Fayyad: ""The kind of state that we want to have, that we aspire to have, is one that would definitely espouse high values of tolerance, co-existence, mutual respect and deference to all cultures, religions. No discrimination whatsoever, on any basis whatsoever. Jews to the extent they choose to stay and live in the state of Palestine will enjoy those rights and certainly will not enjoy any less rights than Israeli Arabs enjoy now in the State of Israel."" 




> The charter of Hamas, which emerged as the largest faction in the only election held, explicitly calls for the genocide of Jews and Israelis.

This is close to the truth, Hamas has called for the expulsion of the 'immigrant jews'. 


> The Palestinian Authority depicts Jews as “the offspring of apes and pigs” and calls for their extermination. This is communicated every day by the political leadership, including mullahs in the mosques and the state-controlled media. It is a society in which children from kindergarten are brainwashed into believing that the highest goal in Islam is to achieve martyrdom in the course of killing Jews.

This is total nonsense. Perhaps someone in the PA has done this but this is not the PA's position nor is it institutionalized in any way. 

> The demonization of Israel and promotion of the culture of death incite individuals to strike out and kill Jews in concert or randomly. The “heroic” scenes of youngsters stabbing Jews, the praise by Abbas himself of martyrs “with holy blood” and the totally contrived religious frenzy accusing Israelis of planning to destroy Al-Aqsa mosque, coalesce into a witch’s brew of primeval rage and hatred.

When Abbas made the statement of the 'pure blood' of the Palestinians being killed on the Temple Mount it was during a specific riot where there wasnt a single stabbing and several Palestinians were wounded. He was not talking about any stabbing or terrorist incident. 


> The PA provides generous state salaries to terrorists apprehended by Israelis and if they are killed, their families are remunerated — partly from funds provided by Western countries. The religious and political leadership at all levels sanctifies terrorists as heroes and national martyrs. City squares, schools and even football clubs are named in their honor.

The Law of the Prisoner doesnt apply to 'terrorists', it applies to all families of people who have been detained or killed by the Israeli occupation forces for any political reason. Some are terrorists, many are not, and the payments are proportionate to the number of dependents that that detained or killed individual is leaving behind. 


> Most of us seek to separate ourselves from our Palestinian neighbors, but to create a neighboring crime-permeated state in the current circumstances would be insane. Aside from the turbulence in the region and the threat from Iran and ISIS, we would be creating an adjoining state pledged to our destruction or a candidate for an ISIS or Iranian takeover.


No, Israel would not. They would be signing a permanent peace treaty with a state pledged to recognize it and refrain from conflict with it, and which would be demilitarized. Additionally every single Arab country has agreed to recognize Israel, sign a peace treaty with Israel, and normalize relations with it if Israel agrees to the two state solution. 

> And we should be under no illusions. Most Palestinians favoring a two-state solution consider this only as a step toward achieving the ultimate goal. The Arafat/Abbas indoctrination process has radicalized successive generations into believing that the only solution to the conflict is the permanent termination of Jewish sovereignty in the area.

The meme is spreading buts its as baseless as it ever was. A demilitarized state, a peace treaty with Israel, and normalization of relations with Israel are not a stepping stone towards destroying Israel. I mean, anyone with any sense must understand how ridiculous this is. Palestine would be in a worse position than ever before to challenge the existence of Israel if it agreed to an end of the occupation and a regional peace agreement with Israel. 




> On what basis can he allege that exposing such truths represents “disgusting … racism”? Besides, since when are Palestinians a race?
The Nazis transformed the majority of Germans into genocidal barbarians and imposed a widely-accepted evil criminal culture on the nation. That does not imply racial prejudice against individual Germans under Nazism any more than against Palestinians living under the barbaric culture imposed on them by their leaders.

""Palestinians arent even a real people man, they are like Nazis"" - he said unironically. 



> A personal aside: I oppose a one-state solution because this would transform us into a binational state. I have no simple solutions but the status quo accompanied by social and economic progress appears to be the only strategy on which to operate until the Palestinians come to their senses and produce leaders reconciled to coexist in peace with us.


I think we all know very well what this guys intentions are.

The evidence is presented right in front of you. The first line of the HAMAS charter states ‘Israel will exist ans will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it has obliterated others before it.’. Furthermore, the events on Oct. 7 have also shown the brutality of HAMAS, which is on par with ISIS and Al-Qaeda. 

And before anyone says the attacks were fabricated by the IDF, you are deluded. The footage was published by HAMAS themselves and they proudly claim these attacks. 

HAMAS also uses the Palestinian people as human shields so they can claim the morale high ground when people die. News flash: war is not a numbers game. The Germans lost more than the British and Americans combined in WW2, so can you say the Germans were victims? 

Peace in the Middle East will only come when both sides want peace. And for now, all I can see is that peace has been rejected vehemently by the terrorist orgs in the West Bank and Gaza.

IsraelPalestine,An appeal to reasonable people around the world,Opinion,13/10/2023 12:42:46,"I'm back after a temporary ban for the way I responded to some of the replies to my ""Open letter"" post earlier in the week. But this post will take on a much different tone. Writing and sharing my thoughts is one of the ways I'm processing everything that is happening.

Those of you who have read my posts before will know that I am a staunch supporter of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. But I'm not writing this as a supporter of Israel, or as a Zionist. I'm writing this as a human being who is Jewish. I am a 48 year old, married Jewish father of two university students, and I live in the Toronto area. And for the first time in my life I am genuinely scared for me, my family, and my people. And every Jewish person I have spoken with has reported feeling the same way. I originally wrote a version of this at 5am after tossing and turning for an hour.

I am scared because a shift has taken place in the world that is terrifying. I felt the trauma that other Jews felt after the attack itself, but we can deal with traumatic events. We're used to it and we're a resilient people. Once the initial trauma wore off for me, I actually started to feel more uplifted. I was warmed by the overwhelming voices of support and solidarity, and the strong words of condemnation for the attack and the rallies that were taking place in support of the attack. But that uplifting feeling has given way to more trauma and fear.

The supportive voices have been drowned out by voices of hate all over the world. People taking to the streets and to university campuses to show their support for the brutal terror attacks. Now before you jump right to, ""Well free speech, people have the right to protest against Israel,"" please take a breath and look up some of the videos of these rallies. These people aren't protesting anything. They're not speaking out against Israeli policies; they're not pleading with Israel to show restraint in its retaliation; they're not even appealing to people like you to donate to Gaza relief funds or anything of that nature. They are openly justifying and calling for a genocide of the Jewish people. They are celebrating the carnage that took place as a form of ""resistance against the oppression,"" and implicitly (and sometimes explicitly) calling for more of it. Student unions at our universities, which are supposed to represent our children, are issuing statements of solidarity with the Palestinians and celebrating the resistance. Jewish students are scared to go to school. And university admins are standing back and doing nothing, ""cuz free speech"" and ""student unions are independent from administration"" and all that. I watched a video yesterday of female Jewish students at the University of Washington who were hysterical in tears and pleading with an administrator on the grounds of the school because they had to walk past a gauntlet of ""protesters"" telling them they deserve to die. These rallies have even taken place on the streets of Toronto, which is one of the most diverse and tolerant cities in one of the most diverse and tolerant countries on the planet.

It's important to appreciate the significance of what is happening. This must be what it felt like for our ancestors in Europe in the 1930's, watching angry rallies blaming Jewish people for their problems and justifying violence to address those problems. Experts have spent decades studying the psychology of the Holocaust to understand both how the kind of evil can exist that can drive people to commit such heinous acts, but also how other people can justify and support it. And there are now generations of people born after WWII that are starting to understand, because we are seeing eerie similarities now.

This has to stop. Solidarity with Palestine has officially crossed the line into calls for genocide. If you find yourself screaming that an entire population of people deserves to be brutally massacred in the name of ""decolonization"" or ""resistance to oppression,"" you have lost your way as a human being. Moderate voices must rise up and drown out these extremists.

When I began doing so, I also began taking a strong interest in the very real problems with anti-semitism around the world.\n\nThis might seem puzzling. But my firm belief is that acknowledging the suffering of the civil population of one people while ignoring the suffering of the other is not only immoral. It is one of the key mechanisms underlying the self-perpetuating nature of conflicts. \n\nWhether you identify as pro-palestinean or pro-israeli I believe that you should have an interest in guarding the civil population of both sides. Because crimes against one civil population can and will be used to justify crimes against the other. This conviction has only been further strenghtened during the past week, where it seem to me that this is exactly what has happened.\n\nSo I definitely feel this and I agree wholeheartedly with you.']"

Unfortunately, it is well known (and confirmed by US, Nato, EU, UNRWA and even Hamas officials themselves) that Hamas is using human shields in Gaza. Namely, Hamas operates within civilian areas, hides behind hospitals and use school as terror bases with the intent of increasing civilian casualties as much as possible when Israel retaliates.\n\nUnlike Hamas, who does everything in its power to kill civilians (both Israelies and Palestinians), Israel is taking multiple actions to save civilians. These actions include:\n\n1. Evacuating 250,000 Israelies from Gaza envelop and north of Israel.\n\n2. Developing the iron dome, an advanced defensive system that intercepts rockets aimed at civilians.\n\n3. Sending pamplets with warnings to evacuate Palestinian civilians from Northen Gaza to safer areas in the south. (Hamas told the civilians these pamplets are Israeli propaganda, shot civilians who went south and blocked the roads)\n\n4. During the war with Hamas, in midst of battle, Israel have risked its own soldiers in order to create humanitarian corridors that were used to evacuate civilians safely. (Hamas launched an attack on Israeli soldiers while they were defending the Palestinian civilians).\n\n5. Text, voice message and even call people in Gaza and ask them to evacuate.\n\n6. Donate incobators to shifa hospital. Tried to donate fuel, but Hamas did not allow that.\n\n7. Helped evacuating 30+ babies from shifa hospital (which was used by Hamas terrorists) to a hospital in Egypt.\n\n8. And much more...\n\nIsraelies value life, Hamas values death. If you support Israel you support life and the efforts to reunite the families whose children, babies, grandmother, grandfather, father, mother or other siblings were kidnapped. If you support Hamas you support death, rape, religious hatred (antisemitism), terror, revenge and more actions that are so disguisting I prefer not to even mention here.\n\n\nBonus: you can add that Israel have warned  the world for years, including the UN, that Hamas practices human shields. This is known and confirmed for at least 9 years.

I do not support Bibi, and neither do many Jews, both Israelis and diaspora.\n\nAs more people immigrate to Israel, either for religious reasons, refugee reasons (yes Jews are still persecuted in parts of the globe), or for other reasons, they need a place to live. The settlements provide an easy and cheap way for many of these people to live in Israel. Not saying this is ethical, but its just one of the reasons why settlements continue to expand.\n\nMy hope is after the dust settles in Gaza, a new government can be established in Gaza, and a new leader & party can be elected in Israel - One that is more sympathetic to Palestinians and their struggle for statehood, while also maintaining safety and prosperity for Israelis.

IsraelPalestine,"Europe, don't delude yourself: It's not despair that's driving Muslims to ISIS - it's hope",Opinion,20/11/2015 15:39:18,,"['[deleted]', '[deleted]', 'Another lefty Haaretz article!', 'Relevant :\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Kx0Mayz.jpg', 'Highly relevant article given some conversations I had with other users yesterday. Paywall break:\n\n>Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom is worried by the rising tide of young Swedes who are joining the Islamic State. “Here again, you come back to situations like that in the Middle East where not least the Palestinians see that there isn’t any future [for them]. [The Palestinians] either have to accept a desperate situation or resort to violence,” she said. Her remarks provoked fury in Israel, and Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon even called them “shocking in their chutzpah. ... [She] exhibit[ed] genuine hostility.”\n\n>The Foreign Ministry and the many Israelis who hastened to rebuke Wallstrom are wrong this time. Wallstrom may not be a member of the World Zionist Organization, but she is the first important European politician to confirm — albeit inadvertently — the common argument in Israel that the currents pushing young Europeans into the arms of terror are not different from the currents in our region.\n\n>Muslims living in Sweden, the most generous of all European states to Muslim migrants, join Islamic State for exactly the same reasons that their co-religionists in Mosul, Jenin and Jaljulya throng to it. If the motivation, as the forgivers of the world would have it, is indeed despair, then they are admitting that the paradise provided to Muslims by Europe, and especially Sweden — generates despair whose results are no less murderous than those generated in the hell of the Middle East. \n\n>Anyone who advances the paradigm of desperation — including the perplexed in Israel — are making a fundamental mistake. Islamic State does not act out of desperation. Just the opposite: It is faith and hope that are driving the Islamic offensive against the free world. The West, captive to the conceit of desperation, refuses to correctly understand this insane hope and as a result it cannot suppress it.\n\n>The symptoms of desperation are the polar opposites of those of faith and hope. The desperate do not believe that they can change reality and are inclined to passivity. The hopeful, in contrast, believe that if they take active measures, even insane ones, they will achieve their goal. In the case of Islamic State it is a global Islamic caliphate that includes, yes, Sweden and France, Germany and Belgium. Even if it is not their primary aim, the Muslim migrants to Europe will constitute the demographic infrastructure.\n\n>The flaccidity of the West is among the accelerators of this hope. The terror acts will expedite the realization of the sacred cause. After all, Allah wants the entire world to follow the path of Islam. Wallstrom, as well as more-senior European and American statesmen, personify this feebleness. If the organizations of destruction felt the death squads had no chance of defeating Western civilization, they would not have moved the arena of madness to Europe.\n\n>The Islamic threat is not like the threat posed by Hitler, but its goals are similar: imposing the reign of darkness over the free world. If this world stops following its heart’s desires blindly, as it did 75 years ago, it will win this war too. The questions are whether — and when — it will wake up and open its eyes, and whether it is willing to defeat the enemy decisively, as it did in World War II. Judging by the current situation, the free world’s moves show that it is not ready, not even after the events in Paris, to go all the way. It lacks the resolution and the right leaders to do so. Like Israel, it will wage operation after operation after operation. And, also like Israel, it will not lack for excuses.', ""The article didn't say Hamas' goal is to establish an Islamic caliphate.

Terrorism is political violence. It\'s a response to political circumstances. \n\nThere seems to be an extreme difficulty with the word terrorism. The West has terrorized the entire third world in a cruel manner, but of course int he West you\'re not going to be told that this is a form of terror. To be blunt, it\'s a ""war on decolonization."" \n\nMost 3rd world nations have heavily influence by stronger outside powers that for one reason or another found interest in the country; resources, location, support in the region, etc. Normally when a third world nation grows more powerful or independent, there is a wave of excuses used by the West to attack them. The West is scared to see a government that *actually* represents the people and is opposed to imperial influence to hold power in any of these countries. Hence the reason most of West after WWII has supported 3rd world dictatorships and then opposed any national liberation movements. \n\nWhat we see in the Middle East to day isn\'t very different than what happened to 19th century Africa. The US and others were scared of Arab nationalism because it meant the end of Western influence. So it\'s extremely unlikely the United States and others contributing in the conflict in Syria have the best interest for establishing a stable, representative government in the country.

IsraelPalestine,This is a propaganda war,Discussion,13/10/2023 16:14:03,"Biden claimed that he saw photos of beheaded babies... then [the white house retracted that claim](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/white-house-biden-has-not-seen-or-independently-confirmed-hamas-beheaded-israeli-children/). The world news sub posted that first story and it gained 26k likes, but if you post that retraction story, you will get shadow-banned from ALL of Reddit (this happened to one of my other accounts).

They're using this to justify a genocide against all Gazans, and not just Hamas. On the other hand, Gazans have been producing proof FOR YEARS of all the civilians, including babies, that Israel has killed, and this has never made a difference to the pro-Israel crowd.

>""There are still images of babies murdered by Hamas, and that makes them just as bad as ISIS""

I won't argue against this point, because I'm not here to defend Hamas. But if murdering babies makes a group as bad as ISIS... why isn't this line of reasoning also used against the government of Israel for all the babies they've killed through the decades? You have an entire government, which is just as bad as ISIS by your reasoning, that is being backed by the strongest super power in the world and is armed with nuclear weapons, and you have no issue with any of that?

Another method they're using to justify genocide is that you'll often see stuff like

>""if you're gay/trans/lesbian/etc. and you go to Gaza you will be killed, so why do you want to free Palestine?""

To that I say: That same logic can be used to justify literally every genocide in the early 20th century and earlier, since nearly everyone was homophobic back then. Do you not see how insane that reasoning is? Not to mention: In all these groups that were genocided, as well as Gazans, THERE WERE/ARE ALREADY LGBT PEOPLE WHOM YOU ARE JUSTIFYING GENOCIDE AGAINST. You are feigning care for LGBT people but at the same time advocating for their death.

If you hear or read any news or opinion on Israel-Palestine, ask yourself: Does it make sense? Is there evidence for it? Do not fall for the propaganda.","['Show me a single Israeli government or military official calling for the genocide of all Gazans. Complete and udder garbage. There are dead Israelis - over 1300 now. You cannot deny this and arguing over how they died is honestly unnecessary - they were murdered. \n\nAlso let me be clear as I represent the ""pro-Israeli"" side - which imo is only a name given by people who don\'t know that this conflict is not in back and white. WE DO NOT WANT CIVILIANS TO DIE. Ever. If you see someone on either side of this conflict encourage the killing of civilians, know that most of us wholly condemn this.\n\nThe reason why Israel is not the same as Hamas is because there is a CLEAR difference between actively targeting civilians and being caught in a crossfire. Hamas targeted civilians, putting it with the likes of ISIS. Israel targets buildings where weapons are being stored or are being used for terrorist planning. When Israel alerts residents to leave and Hamas forces them to stay where they are - civilians lose their lives. This is the key difference that pro-pali supports just cant seem to wrap their heads around. If you don\'t see the difference I don\'t know what to tell you. Also the nuclear power comment is silly. Israel will never use nukes on Gaza so this is a ridiculous thing to bring up.\n\nLastly, people bring up the LGBT thing not to justify killing Gazans, but to show the clear hypocrisy of the pro-LGBT+ crowd who show support to a people who would certainly murder them, while Israel allows anyone to be LGBT+. This again, is not justification for violence, but simply to point out the delusion of supporting a group of people who would certainly not support you back. \n\nNo one is justifying genocide, because there isn\'t one happening. The population of Gaza has been continuously growing and the goal of the Israeli military is to eliminate Hamas, not all of Gaza.', 'Was the video of the Thai man beheaded by Hamas on the day of the massacre not in line with ISIS? \n\nThere various other reasons calling them ISIS besides beheading babies. \n\nIf you’re going to present the “whataboutism” argument, at the very least do some basic research about this conflict. This isn’t the first period nor time Israel has experienced isolated major terror attacks on their civilians by Hamas. This is a very shocking even because of the scale (1300 deaths in one day) of murder and inhumane behavior displayed by Hamas, like an ISIS milita takeover. But to present the accumulation of years of abuse by Israel on Palestine while being obtuse about the long history of attacks on Israelis by Palestinians as well.. Silly. \n\nIt makes a lot of sense to criticize Pro LGBT organization suffering cognitive dissonance and support Palestinian activism that supports Hamas attacks. No one is criticizing them for supporting UN humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians. People are criticizing them for actively engaging with crowds that shout slogans about dead Jews and believing that the men who would tie them up to their motorcycles and drag them along the streets of Gaza for being gay are not by any means on the scale of ISIS crazy. No no', '> Biden claimed that he saw photos of beheaded babies... then the white house retracted that claim. \n\nAnd the IDF confirmed it on the record.  \n\n> They\'re using this to justify a genocide against all Gazans, \n\nThere is no genocide going on.  Why would Israel be bothering with expensive precision munitions rather than cheap dumb artillery if the goal were genocide?  This is simply a lie.\n\n> On the other hand, Gazans have been producing proof FOR YEARS of all the civilians, including babies, that Israel has killed, and this has never made a difference to the pro-Israel crowd.\n\nWell no.  In general the pro-Israel crowd finds Gazan policy abhorrent.  Gaza is the one who declared war.  Gaza is the one who insists on attacking.  Gaza is the one who has kept this thing going for 17 years.  Gaza could very easily have decided to be Singapore but they didn\'t. \n\n> But if murdering babies makes a group as bad as ISIS... why isn\'t this line of reasoning also used against the government of Israel \n\nBecause ""murder"" isn\'t collateral damage. Murder requires specific intent.  Israel tries to hit military targets against an army that does not practice distinction.  That is Hamas doesn\'t wear uniforms, they don\'t mark their military buildings and they don\'t separate them from civilian infrastructure.  That\'s going to increase the number of Gazan civilian fatalities.  Israel has some responsibility to be cautious here.  But the government with ultimate responsibility for the well being of Gazans is Hamas, their government. \n\nHamas, atypically for them, decided to conduct an attack to cause maximum moral outrage.  That\'s an ISIS tactic.\'\n\n> That same logic can be used to justify literally every genocide in the early 20th century and earlier, since nearly everyone was homophobic back then. \n\nFirst off the question being raised is that Israel was a leader on these issues in the 1990s.  Just as they (the Yishuv and Israel) had been a leader on women\'s roles from the 1920s onwards.   Today they are a bit of a laggard so the argument isn\'t as sticky.  \n\nIn any case Palestinians values are mostly in line with the dramatic shifts in the rest of the Arab world.  Those dramatic shifts are very bad, but I think Egyptians and Saudis deserve a lot of the blame and Palestinians almost none of it.  It does however provide one of many many reasons that the Israeli society should be the one to win out over the Palestinian culture.  \n\nAs for your historical point I\'ll briefly dissent.  Societies say in the 1950s certainly were homophobic by today\'s standards.  But there were well known ""confirmed bachelors"" who had ""stable roommates"". Or ""spinsters"" who lived together.  Tolerance rather than social sanction was a norm.  Many things were considered fine if you kept them quiet.  1950s culture was about agreeing to appear to conform to rigid expectations, because of that actual ideological conformity was less important to them.  Today people can get horribly  disciplined for the slightest misstep. \n\n> If you hear or read any news or opinion on Israel-Palestine, ask yourself: Does it make sense? Is there evidence for it?

IsraelPalestine,Is the current Israel campaign helping or deterring future peace for both sides?,,06/11/2023 22:14:23,"[Here’s an interesting article](https://time.com/6329776/hamas-isis-gaza/) I found from Monica Marks, an assistant professor at NYU Abu Dhabi who focuses on Islamist movements in the Middle East. Honestly this gave me a bit more perspective on Hamas and the difference in motive than ISIS.

It says
To combat security threats effectively, Israeli leaders must resist facile comparisons and reckon with the fact that, at the heart of Hamas’s appeal among many of its recruits, lies not religious extremism but anger, anguish, and hopelessness. A hydra that feeds off of embittered youths will not be defeated by creating more destruction and despair.

The Palestinian national violence stems from hope and the idea that they can win, and not from despair. It\'s why the ""safest"" periods in Israel\'s history were after 48 and 67, when the Arab population were still reeling from Israel\'s successes and therefore held much less hope of destroying Israel through military might. \nIt\'s also why there has generally been *more* violence each time Israel makes concessions, because the Palestinians view the concessions as a mark of weakness on Israel\'s part and the various national movements use it as proof of the success of their terrorism. This is exactly what happened now with Hamas, because the Israeli Military and Shabak believed that making concessions like allowing Gazans into Israel and funneling Qatari money into Gaza would lessen the desire for conflict. It\'s also why the previous government gave over maritime territory that Israel controlled to Lebanon, because they thought it would improve the lives of the Lebanese and therefore weaken Hezbollah\'s power.

IsraelPalestine,"""Israel abandons precision bombing in favour of ‘damage and destruction"" is a false statement",Opinion,29/10/2023 21:25:22,"This is a headline taken from an article that was made by the Telegraph:

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/11/israel-abandon-precision-bombing-eliminate-hamas-officials/

Many people use this article to point out that Israel is attacking with no regard for civilian lives (and some even claim this as proof of crimes against humanity).
But when you read the article it is nowhere said that this is what the IDF has stated nor that it is doing this actively.
This is what the IDF spokesperson really said:
""We are not stopping; on the contrary, we are heading toward increased attacks. The top priority in the attacks is to eliminate senior [Hamas] officials""

In this article, they say that Israel has stopped doing ""roof knocking"" which is warning areas before attacks by flyers they throw from the skies or phone calls.

An article from the Washington Post explaining how that works:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/07/14/video-this-is-what-an-israeli-roof-knock-looks-like/

When you continue to read there is something that might imply that the headline is honest but it is only an estimation made by the one that wrote the article and not a statement made by IDF.

""The air war appears to be aimed at flattening large parts of Gaza and subduing Hamas resistance before a full-scale ground invasion of troops.""

IsraelPalestine,Zionism vs Judaism (Percentage Compatibility?),Discussion,26/11/2023 19:34:29,"So, from my understanding. 

Zionism is about the pursuit of an independent Jewish state. Ran 100% for and By the Jewish people. 

So a Zionist is someone who belongs to or supports a political movement that had as its original aim the creation of a country for Jewish people.

I understand that not all Jews are Zionist and not all Zionist are Jews (for example Christian Zionist) 

So For those who are Jewish, who follow the Torah, and who are also Zionist.

My question is, 

Fundamentally wouldn’t Zionism be opposed to the Torah / Judaism? 

Due to it’s political ideologies rather than its religious ones.

For example: the establishment of Israel can only be made when the Jewish Messiah / prophet comes.

So the fact that religious Jews are against this political movement just raises questions. 

(I don’t not support any forms of violence towards innocent civilians)

But think about it….Just like how a majority of Religious Muslim are against the political movement of ISIS because they claim that they aren’t following the Quran. 

I just find it very weird how the Muslim community kept telling the world that ISIS etc…as a minority doesn’t represent the whole of Islam. (Which is true) However, it seems like the minority of Israel / Zionist keep telling the world that they are the voices of the majority of the Jewish people…(Which is not true)

Please help me understand with all sincerity.","['Something that this new wave of anti-Israel people are doing is trying to make “Zionist” into some kind of boogeyman. \n\nWe are in a post-Zionist society. It’s funny that this term has had a revival of sorts. The goal of Zionism was achieved in 1948 - an independent state for the Jewish people in part of their homeland. \n\nIf you believe that Jews have a right to a sovereign state in all or part of what is today Israel, then you too are a Zionist', ""The reason most Jews support Zionism and are pro Israel (unlike the fringe religious groups i.e. Nutrei Karta) is because our subjugation and scapegoating was not a function of religious belief but was based purely on ethnicity/culture. \n\nAnti-semitism is not related to religion but to ethnicity, that's why the Reich didn't care if you were a religious jew but only cared if you had some great-grandfather who had some fraction of Jewish blood. \n\nThat's a major tenet of anti-semitism, the belief that Jewish blood is tainted and makes you inherently evil and subhuman.  \n\nThat's why the majority of Jewish people (and I promise it's a vast majority) support a state of our own where we are able to govern ourselves and protect ourselves from outside forces.\n\nMost religious Jews are pro-Israel, be it reform, conservative, orthodox, Hasidic, Haredi. There are only small groups of ULTRA Orthodox Jews that are anti-Israel for the reason you stated from the Torah."", 'We don’t have polls on this, but we do know that [eight out of ten American Jews say caring about Israel is an essential part of their Jewishness, and six in ten feel an emotional attachment with Israel.](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-connections-with-and-attitudes-toward-israel/) Given that Israel houses half the worlds Jewish population, that all major Jewish religious movements (orthodox, reform, conservative, reconstructionist) recognize and support Israel’s right to exist, and that Zionism was originally a secular movement, it is safe to say that the vast majority of Jews are Zionists, as in they support Israel’s continued existence. \n\nThe Torah is not opposed to this, the vast majority of Jewish religious leaders agree on that. The re-establishment of the biblical kingdom of Israel and the rebuilding of the temple requires the messiah to come back. The state of Israel and the kingdom of Israel are not the same, so no problems there.', '// the establishment of Israel can only be made when the Jewish Messiah / prophet comes   \n\n\nThis is only one (marginal?) interpretation of a single line from Talmud, not some universal understanding within Judaism.', 'I am answering this from my perspective as someone who used to be Orthodox Jewish and is now secular. From my experience, there is a huge amount of misunderstanding around this topic, including from Jews, but especially from non-Jews who are anti-Israel.\n\nThere is a saying, ""two Jews, three opinions"", and this issue is no exception. There is a wide diversity of opinion within religious Judaism about this.\n\nBasically, there are two distinct issues here from the religious standpoint:\n\n1. Should Jews live in Israel during exile?\n2. Should Jews have a Jewish state in Israel during exile?\n\nAnd the second actually includes two sub-questions:\n\n* Should a Jewish state have been founded?\n* Given that it was, what should be done now?\n\nRegarding the first question, Orthodox Jews are basically unanimous. It is considered to be a very good thing religiously to live in Israel. The reason is that the land itself is considered holy and there are Mitzvot (commandments) that can only be done in Israel. As doing as many of these Mitzvot as possible is very important to religious Jews, many religious Jews have always had the goal of moving there, even way before Zionism as a concept existed. They didn\'t care who was in charge--they just wanted to practice their religion to the best of their ability.\n\nRegarding the second, there are a huge variety of different opinions that run from the belief that setting up a Jewish state is completely forbidden to the idea that setting up a Jewish state is extremely important and can help bring the Messiah, and a whole bunch of things in between. In short, I would group the opinions as the following:\n\n1. Religious Zionists: This group believes that setting up the Jewish state is an important step before the Messiah comes and has religious significance.\n2. Ultra-Orthodox, or, in Hebrew, Charedim: There is a diversity of opinions in this group, but basically none of them believe what I wrote above, that the state is necessary for the coming of the Messiah.\n\nSome have the opinion that, while it wasn\'t necessary to establish a state for religious reasons, it is fine that it was done and are happy it exists. Some think that the state never should have been established, but since it was, it is critical to protect it for the safety of the Jews living there (This was also my opinion back when I was religious. I would also guess that it is the most popular opinion among this group, although I am unsure of this.). And some are very against any recognition of the Israeli government, even to the degree of not accepting funding.\n\nThis results in the interesting situation where there are people who would be very offended if you call them Zionists (as they personally associate this term with ""Religious Zionists""), but are nevertheless against the recognition of a Palestinian state or a one-state solution primarily because they are worried about safety, not for religious reasons per-se. These people would never fly an Israeli flag, but aren\'t anti-Zionist in the way that most outsiders think. And many likely would be open to something like a two-state solution if they would believe that the Jews in Israel would be safe. (Of course, the problem is that it actually would have to be safe.)', 'Zionism is originally secular movement actually. But there is a religious stream of it called ""Religious Zionism"" that is well supported in Halahka. Even the majority of religious who believe the ""three oaths"" still apply will say Klal Yisrael takes priority over it.\n\nedit: expand - let me define some things as I see it\n\n* Halahka: Jewish law\n* Three oaths: the part of Jewish law which prohibits Jews to create a Jewish state by force. It has a conditional clause, ""the gentile nations do not harm us"". Many Jews (""Religious Zionists"") believe this was violated, the gentile nations harmed Jews, thus not only making a Jewish state permitted, but making it obligatory.\n* Klal Yisrael: Lit. All of Israel. The belief that Jews have an obligation to each other, and taking politics which would severely harm Jewish interests or security would be a major sin. This is widely believed by even the most religious Jews, so even Jews who would otherwise believe the three oaths still apply would still not come out too harshly on Israel, especially publicly or to gentiles. Even Satmar one of the most anti-Zionist sects follow this.', ""Religious Judaism is zionistic in that settling in and living in the land of Israel is a commandment and the highest ultimate earthly goal for a Jewish person.  \n\nSecular zionists approach living in the land of Israel from a more pragmatic, self-sovereignty perspective.  Since they have been discriminated against and slaughtered every time they've not been the ruling power, they feel the need to have a Jewish state.\n\nThese ideas are compatible.  There are a few fringe sects (e.g. neturei karta) that believe and claim it is heretical or disallowed to establish a Jewish state prior to the coming of the Moshiach (the next Jewish king).  However, they comprise somewhere well under 1% of religious Jews.  In fact, some sources indicate that there are only a few hundred to a few thousand who participate in anti-Israel activity.  And they are largely discredited because they have endoresed groups like Hizbullah and the Ayatollah Khamenei, who are openly genocidal against the Jews; which shows there is some other pathology going on with them.\n\nThe pont is, both religious and long held cultural values support living in Israel as well as modern ethics related to self-rule.  The idea that zionists are strictly anti-religious is not true anymore, and wasn't even true in the beginning; although most of the early zionist settlers were socialists and left leaning politically."", '"" For example: the establishment of Israel can only be made when the Jewish Messiah / prophet comes."" this isn\'t correct because if it was we wouldn\'t be here having this conversation and second we want to live in peace but they want to massacre every jew in the world that is why Israel needs to exist, Judiasm is Zionism you can\'t deny this its a fact when never say next year in Africa or America we say next year in Jeruslem which is something jews have been saying ever since they were brutally Exiled from their homeland by many empires!!!!
