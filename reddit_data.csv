IsraelPalestine,"Hamas is a TERRORIST org like ISIS, Al Qaeda or Taliban",,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"People are forgetting that Hamas is as much a terrorist organization as ISIS or Al Qaeda or the Taliban

Hamas has actively killed any political rivals such as Fatah as they are not Islamic enough. This is what the Taliban and Daesh do, kill any peaceful political Muslim rival parties and use Fascism to get into and maintain power under the guise of religion. 

This is a catastrophic shortsighted blunder by Hamas, not only are they descending upon Israelis like ISIS style Jihadis, the whole world will see the obvious terror outfit this organization is. Muslims will make themselves more liable by siding with Hamas as they lack the nuance to see Palestine without a terrorist organization like Hamas being it's representative.

Most are too politically naive to realize that you don't poke a bear you can't fight. These guys have a few rockets and Iran backing them for their own nefarious political gains, that don't even align with the Palestinians long term safety in mind. You really think you can yell Allahu Akbar and take on the Israeli or US militaries. Do you want them to carpet bomb you? Hamas is being as suicidal and as unplanned as you'd expect from typical inbred Jihadis. 

This has never been a simple battle between Palestine and Israel. Israel is a strategic country, almost like a forward operating Base and it's existence will be maintained no matter what by western nations for their control in the middle east. Are Muslims this politically naive? Look at social media right now

Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn\'t listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal.

Before you criticize Israel, ask these questions to yourself,

1) Hamas initiated the attack. 
2) they didn‚Äôt attack the army but the civilians of Israel. 
3) they raped women, beheaded babies and killed ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù brutally. 
4) they hide behind their own civilians so that they can raise issues like this. 
5) they make the operational bases under hospitals and civilian homes. 
6) they tell the whole world that we are not responsible to protect our own civilians, it‚Äôs Israel‚Äôs responsibility, even though we killed their civilians and hide behind ours. 
7) all the Muslim nations condemning Israel‚Äôs self defence but not condemning Hamas attack on Israeli civilians. 
8) why Muslim nations are not taking their Palestinian brothers and sisters as refugees in their own nations?
9) instead of condemning Hamas aggression, why are they not trying to tell Hamas to release the hostages and stop their aggression?
10) why is Hamas using the aid for Palestinian people for their own terrorists?
11) why are the Muslims around the globe protesting against Israel self defence but they were quite when Hamas murdered Israeli civilians? 
12) why Hamas leader broadcasted a meeting in a south Indian state where he said ‚Äúbulldoze hidutava and all the Hindus? Why Muslims nations are not condemning the spread of religious hatred by Hamas?

All over social media people are showing the videos of Hamas and hostages waving to each other and saying goodbye etc:

One, in the video with the lady and little girl in the van, the Hamas dude audibly says ""keep waving"". 

Two, people are comparing these videos to two photos that supposedly show IDF arresting what looks to be two boys around age 10-14, with absolutely no context as to why they were being detained, to ""prove"" that Hamas are kind and humane and the IDF are the real terrorists. 

My question is this: Have any of you Palestine leaning people even considered the likelihood that they're under coercion to act this way? They are being told to wave as if to friends they're going to miss, while being released from captivity by masked ""militants"" carrying AK's. 

Have you even considered the fact that they might have been told to say favourable things to the media in exchange for the safety of other hostages, hostages they may even have gotten to know the past 50 days? In every video I've seen, the hostages look incredibly uncomfortable in my opinion , they look to be under duress. 

The idea that a video of waving ""proves"" terrorists who just committed a mass slaughter of civilians are actually kind and humane is insane to me. 

Also, do you think these people, who have just been through an extremely traumatic ordeal no matter how you think Hamas treated them, not being forced in front of cameras really means Israel is trying to cover up the fact that Hamas are actually sensitive, compassionate individuals?","['Any video of hostages shot before they were released is by definition non-consensual, double so if they are minors. \n\nPeople who distribute these videos on the social media should be ashamed of themselves.', 'I feel like people forget what hostage means.

IsraelPalestine,What is it with the American left and downplaying Hamas?,Discussion,16/10/2023 17:43:21,"I am a full Leftist on pretty much everything, but this is one thing that confuses me a lot. Let me also clarify, that I don‚Äôt agree with the right wing position on this subject either (basically just the opposite of this, supporting Israel and downplaying their government‚Äôs atrocities). But, as a member of multiple leftist communities on this site, I am constantly seeing people fully supporting Palestine with the justification that what Hamas does isn‚Äôt as bad as what Israel does. I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence, but what I don‚Äôt understand is everyone chanting ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù and showing no remorse for the Israeli people that were harmed. About the phrase ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù: on a surface level, this phrase is perfectly fine. However, I like to compare this phrase to the phrase ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù. On a surface level, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, but it‚Äôs the stigma and history behind it that makes it offensive to say. With all lives matter, it‚Äôs due to it being against the blm movement, and with free Palestine, especially since these horrific events occurred, it‚Äôs due to the phrase subtly implying that the actions of Hamas are justifiable, and even more so, completely disregarding the suffering of those in Israel. Now, I really want to give the left the benefit of the doubt that they don‚Äôt support Hamas, but it‚Äôs starting to get really difficult, with people implying that their actions are for a greater cause. I‚Äôm not necessarily saying that they support Hamas, but I really am starting to see a pattern of them never bringing up the horrible things Hamas has done and only hating on Israel; same with the right, they only talk about how horrible Hamas is with no regards to the atrocities of the Israeli government. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs a 50/50 necessarily, but neither side is justified in the slightest, and all our support should be aimed towards the innocent people of both sides rather than the oppressors of either side. I really want to understand the left on this, because it feels so bizarre that I‚Äôd disagree with them so hard on this, but I just can‚Äôt.","[""The American left believes that it supports underdogs, so people on the left often support Palestinians, who are perceived as underdogs.\n\nFacts that go against this entrenched narrative that Palestinians are underdogs are  ignored by leftists: like the fact that Palestinians are supported by 1.9 billion fellow Muslims, that Israel is a tiny country whose existence has been under threat since its inception and continues to be under threat, due to hostility from neighboring states, that Palestinians elected the theocratic terror group Hamas to represent them and still continue to support the terror group. If anything, it is Israel that is the underdog.\n\nIf you think about it, the ideology of Hamas is exactly what American leftists say they oppose: Hamas is theocratic, misogynistic, homophobic, and intolerant of all other religions - just like the Christian Nationalists in the US that the left is opposed to. But because of anti-Israel propaganda and entrenched, ahistorical narratives about Israel on the left, leftists lose sight of these inconvenient facts about the Israel-Palestine conflict and automatically side with Palestinians no matter how gruesome the Palestinians' actions are."", '>I can agree with the justification to an extent, since Israel is just as  guilty as Hamas when it comes to oppression and violence\n\nWholly disagree. It is in my opinion distinctly different when discussing Gaza. Israel\'s actions regarding Gaza as for the most part fully defensive (think Iron Dome) while Hamas is fully offensive. When Israel retaliates against Hamas during times of more serious terrorist attacks (such as this current one) there is a clear focus on disabling Hamas capabilities and targeting known terrorists. Yes, there are civilian casualties, but I would contend that many of them are likely due to Hamas keeping its civilians where they are, potentially against the civilians\' will. Israel gives forewarning to residents of buildings before they will strike. On the other hand, Hamas\' obvious goal is the total annihilation of Israel and all Jews worldwide. We saw this in action last week and are lucky that their ""call to violence"" did not lead to widespread violence around the globe (with the few small exceptions we\'ve heard about). It\'s just not the same when you look at each entity\'s goals and actions.\n\nAs for your main point, it really is one of the best examples of cognitive dissonance I\'ve ever seen. It really is like that [Eric Andre meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1959067874127057&set=p.1959067874127057&type=3). It is so obviously Hamas that is the root of so many problems pertaining to Gaza but so many don\'t see it this way. There are a few driving factors that I believe have led to Gazan support by the left:\n\n* **9/11 and Islamophobia** \\- Ever since 9/11, the US opinion towards Islam, Muslims, and the Middle East has been rough. Not saying it isn\'t somewhat justified but it has lead to serious racism towards Muslims in America. The far left has always been fighting against this, but in their fight, they have blindly swung to support all things that appear to look like resistance to American (or white) imperialism in the ME. By making Israel appear as a imperialist, white, and warmongering country, many leftists side with Gazans as a force of habit at this point.\n* **Poor knowledge** \\- This goes for both sides but I\'m focusing on the left for now since this post is about them. In this day and age, rarely anyone reads past the headline of an article or gets their news from Instagram stories. This is a very bad way at understanding the situation and the history surrounding it. The left\'s love for making nice-wrapped-up Instagram posts trying to explain the conflict in a few infographics gives people a sense of understanding of the conflict and leaves them with a bad case of the Dunning-Kruger effect. IMO the more people understand the history of Israel, its ties to Jewish people and the circumstances of how it was formed and how Gaza came to be, the more likely they are to not take such a strong pro-Palestinian side. \n* **Cognitive Dissonance** \\- I honestly don\'t know how else to put it that this. Seeing signs of ""Gays for Palestine"" or ""Feminists for Palestine"" really makes me scratch my head. The support coming from these groups without the realization that if they were to openly be themselves or speak about these topics in Gaza, they would most likely be stoned on the spot. I think certain groups who see themselves as marginalized in the US (LGBT+, Atheists, African Americans) think there are similarities between their beliefs and what the average Gazan\'s beliefs are. What they do not realize is how essentially no Gazan would rush to defend a homosexual if the tables were turned.\n\nI could go on about Israel\'s right-wing, corrupt government and how that likely plays are role but my comment is long enough. As a left-winger myself, it brings me so much more pain to see the left dive into their own brand of anti-Semitism compared to the right\'s old and tired antisemitism.', 'Completely agree with this.

IsraelPalestine,Man killed by IDF or Hamas?,,15/11/2023 00:22:35,"Saw [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Czo8n26K55T/?igshid=Y2NkYjk0MDhjYg==) on Instagram on eye on Palestine‚Äôs page. It says that the man was shot after this pic was taken by the IDF. But buried deep down in the comments was a comment that claimed that Hamas shot him because he was seen talking to the IDF and threatened his family to not speak out against them.

Any idea what is the truth behind this? Honestly I am so fed up with all the misinformation. Both sides claim to be lying and it is so easy for the rest of the people to sit at home, in their comfort zones and fuel anti-semitism or Islamophobia when infact the people who are suffering on both sides are helpless.

Also it is super scary to see how people have warmed upto Hamas and no longer see them as the threat they are because of all the misinformation.","['This is no proof.

IsraelPalestine,But do you condemn Hamas?,,01/11/2023 09:50:24,"This question is thrown at me every time I try to talk about ANYTHING related to Palestine. I never applause Hamas and never will. Applause anyone killing a human being generally.

But it‚Äôs very frustrating to have people randomly throw this question here, like I‚Äôm either pro-Israel or I AM pro-Hamas. Why can‚Äôt I be neither?

Also, every time I post or comment with sources I get downvoted and most of the posts here are pro-Israel. I‚Äôm wondering how can we have conversations if that‚Äôs the purpose of this sub if we‚Äôre constantly downvoting the ‚Äúunpopular‚Äù opinion here. It‚Äôll become an echo chamber and useless for dialogue. 

So my invitation. Can we stop it with the downvotes and ACTUALLY have a reasonable conversation without randomly throwing ‚Äúdo you condemn Hamas?‚Äù Please?","['It‚Äôs a completely valid question and everybody, especially Palestinians and Palestinian supporters, should just answer it and say they condemn Hamas‚Äô Oct 7th attacks. Do pro-Palestine activists have no understanding of PR and how the rest of the world feels about terrorists and terrorist sympathizers? The world just had their newsfeed filled with a barrage of tapes of Hamas militants savagely massacring entire families of innocent civilians and then of pro-Palestine activists marching in the street seemingly praising it. That makes them see all Palestinians and Palestinian supports as being pro-terror. As being somebody that could happily massacre them at worst, or celebrate others massacring them at best. \n\nThey need to show the rest of the world that there is a huge difference between Hamas terrorists and Palestinian civilians/Palestinian supporters, that they do not share the same values and are not all violent evil people. People aren‚Äôt going to care about the plight of groups who want them and their families dead. Without condemnations and basic humanity from the Palestinian side of the debate, the rest of the world will see them all the same way they see Hamas and have no sympathy for the Gazan civilians dying or the Palestinian activists being doxxed and fired. \n\nIf you want people to care about you and respect your opinion and see you as a human being, you have to show you have humanity too. \n\nI can 110% unequivocally say I condemn Hamas for the terror attack of 10/7 but that I‚Äôm also heartbroken over the death of every innocent Palestinian and condemn any and all violence against non-combatant civilians.

But I think what people are challenging is the notion that pro-Palestinian = anti Israel. \n\nWho has hindered the Palestinian dream to have their own state and live peacefully?
