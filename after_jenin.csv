180,18.0,"Mainstream news sources print headlines and stories that attract eyeballs and therefore sell advertising. Any time a news story raises your eyebrow, ask yourself who the target audience is, and who buys advertising in that medium. Or, in the case of ad-free media, who funds the medium for street cred and/or tax deductions. No news source will bite the hand that feeds it.

News is, first and foremost, entertainment. And rule number one of entertainment, is though shalt respect thine audience. Rule number two is end on a high note.",2023-02-03 16:31:11
181,18.0,It actually takes a while to research on the news because most sources are bias and do not mention it. Yes there were innocents killed but they should at least mentioned how many were innocent and how many weren’t.,2023-02-03 16:31:11
182,18.0,"It's worth pointing out that it's not just Israel saying these folks belonged to these organizations. It's not a question of ""just take the IDF's word for it,"" in most of these cases the organization in question *are claiming responsibility* for their fighters' actions, and *identifying them as their fighters'.* 

It's frustrating that you need to actually go to Arab media to get things like:

> And the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigade — an armed militia affiliated with Fatah, the secular political party that controls the Palestinian Authority, claimed one of the dead, Izz al-Din Salahat, as a fighter.

Like ... the BBC and the Guardian can't read tweets, too?",2023-02-03 16:31:11
183,18.0,"They aren’t terrorists. Simple as that. They’re partisans. 

The right to resist foreign occupation is enshrined in UN law. 


Also, your media side fails to mention the reasons Palestinians are fighting (perhaps the collective punishment, destruction of their homes, ethnic cleansing, illegal settlements, and blockade have something to do with it?)",2023-02-03 16:31:11
184,18.0,"Finally!!! I can agree with a Zionist for once! 

I hate biased media! They also failed to state that Israel has been illegally building settlements on the West Bank and the suburbs of Jenin. That the settlers kept attacking Palestinian kids and women. That Israel also killed multiple individual Palestinians innocently weeks before the 9 have been killed. That Israel has illegally detained multiple Palestinians before the 9 have been killed. Damn biased mainstream media. Never mention anything.",2023-02-03 16:31:11

187,18.0,"So to be clear, you believe that targeting civilians is actually legal, according to the UN? 

If so, you are wrong, and I can help to educate you if you really think that. But first I want to confirm that I understand your comment correctly and this is actually what you believe.",2023-02-03 16:31:11
188,18.0,"They kill aim for civilians, bomb busses, and shoot rockets at  civilians. Tell me with a straight face they aren't terrorists.",2023-02-03 16:31:11
189,18.0,You fail to mention the requirement of distinguishing themselves from civilians. [Which is a war crime](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-48?activeTab=undefined). And all the buzzwords in your comment show you are not very educated in Int'l law or military matters.,2023-02-03 16:31:11
