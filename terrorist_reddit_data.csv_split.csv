0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"No videos of Israelis launching rockets at Gaza shouting ""god is great!"" while women and children die. Keep in mind, one side goes through great lengths to protect their women and children through the Iron Dome from wanton aggression. The other side hides their combatants behind their women and children, and that tells you almost everything you need to know."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,That's why we all feel like we are taking crazy pills! The goal of Hamas is to massacre Jews not establish a thriving Palestine state! Hamas and Hezbollah serve the interest of Iran.
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,Yes! That’s what people are forgetting because I grew up in the 80s where it was very very common for hamas To kidnap American citizens off the street in Beirut Lebanon. People have forgotten that.
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,Hamas are dogs and need to be threated Like dogs

I think Rabin got it right...

>""Until 1967, Israel did not hold an inch of the Sinai Peninsula and the West Bank, the Gaza Strip or the Golan Heights. Israel held not an acre of what is now considered disputed territory. And yet we enjoyed no peace.  
Year after year Israel called for pleaded for — a negotiated peace with the Arab governments. Their answer was a blank refusal and more war... The reason was not a conflict over territorial claims. The reason was, and remains, the fact that a free Jewish state sits on territory at all.""

0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"I think it goes without saying that Hamas and Palestine are not the same thing. however, my understanding is Hamas was the “elected” (I don’t know the circumstances of how that happened) government of Palestine and for the most part, no one speaks out against them. 
That all being said, I don’t see how anyone comes away from what just occurred in Gaza as a success or anything to be cheered, it’s one thing to “fight the power” and be the rebels to the western empire, it’s another to target fully civilian populations and murder indiscriminately (thinking mainly about the music festival). It doesn’t help that some groups immediately jumped to “Israel started it” rhetoric, I understand the rebels fighting the empire (sorry for the Star Wars referenced) mentality, I don’t understand seeing what Hamas did as anything except terrorism. 
I sincerely hope that retribution is not taken on the Palestinian civilian population for what Hamas did, those lost lives lay squarely on Hamas’ shoulders. I just wish I saw more Palestinian voices speaking out and decrying what took place/ condemning Hamas. Entirely possible I just haven’t seen those voices. 

Full Disclosure: this is my raw opinion on the matter, only got up to speed today on everything going on. I’m not saying this is 100% correct so if you have anything to add or correct, please feel free."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"regardless of who you ""support,"" the terrorists have committed heinous acts. If the Palestinians have any decency, they will kill the terrorists or turn them themselves. I will tell you a little anecdote from my country where a criminal ran rampant; after many years of the government going after him, he successfully evaded them by running to the hills and Forrest, with, of course, help from the locals. Then, after the government caught on what was happening, they decided to educate the citizens by explaining what he was doing was wrong, even if they supported his cause because no one should harm innocent people while fighting the government. So then people didn't listen and kept aiding him, and in return, the government came up with a plan to make them turn in the criminal. So they began to cut off supplies to the towns and people, and slowly, their unwavering support died, and they promptly turned in the criminal without a single gunshot. I think all Palestinians should be aiding Israel by doing the right thing, which is eliminating terrorists, a common enemy to all humanity. I pray and hope for world peace."
0,09/10/2023 16:58:16,"The Palestinian supporters on my social media are saying “Israelis don’t care about their hostages because they are bombing Gaza (with a Hamas fighter here or there). Israel just wants destruction.” I was flabbergasted when I read that. First by saying so casually a Hamas fighter here or there bc Hamas actually did bomb a Gaza hospital so that’s their justification. And second, I promise as a non Palestinian Muslim woman posting that, if you were there in the country you would NOT be spared by Hamas even if you shared their religion. The supporters are protesting while going back to their comfy homes in the States not even comprehending that if Hamas was in the States, even if you supported their country for “resisting against oppression”, they would literally not spare you."

1,17/11/2023 09:46:32,"Terrorists are cowards who attack the weak and helpless and celebrate their deaths because they wouldn’t dare to go against a real army. Unfortunately, the hamas gained sympathy and support of all the liberals because they’re apparently the ‘oppressed’ and the ones facing genocide. IDF is an army protecting their Country from ruthless terrorists like Hamas.

Next time someone calls IDF terrorist, remind them about ISIS, Al Qaeda, Taliban, Hamas- textbook examples of terrorists."
1,17/11/2023 09:46:32,No. It really is as simple as that. Any attempt to call them terrorist is just an attempt to minimize and the actions of Hamas on 10/7 and make the IDF morally the same as the savages in Hamas. Plainly they are not.
1,17/11/2023 09:46:32,No it is not

1,17/11/2023 09:46:32,"Terrorist is a loaded term used to denigrate the other side.   

This is not the IDF's finest day, but they are not terrorists.  

Netanyahu (20+ years of illegal activity and crimes against the Palestinians) and Hamas leadership (12K+ Palestinians dead, not martyred, for no reason other than their self pleasure)...  they are criminals.

It is the leaders we should be angry with."
1,17/11/2023 09:46:32,"Honestly, the amount of absolute wackjobs arguing here that the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, ie, Israel’s military, is a terrorist group, is honestly just disappointing. How stupid are people? 

These are the same leftists that will tell you the US military are terrorists. I honestly don’t think there’s arguing with them. Like we’re literally having the conversation whether the IDF is the terrorist group here, when they’re literally fighting Hamas, the one who stormed across the border, and murdered thousands of men, woman, and children in the name of god."

That makes me the good guy right? Guys?"
2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,"Released hostages have to be very careful, because if they complain about their treatment it could effect the 220 hostages that are still prisoners of Hamas. 
Currently Hamas is holding both women’s husbands."
2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,"They released the first two hostages who had 10 family members still in captivity. 

They released the next two hostages with their husbands still in captivity.

I'll bet you this pattern continues if more hostages are released.

I'd say and do whatever they wanted too if my family was still in there.

It'll be interesting what these released captives *really* have to say once this hostage crisis is over (one way or the other)."
2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,"They hold her husband there also.

It could be true that a Hamas personnel responsible for the hostages was “nice” so what? Does that make them burning babies, children, women, elderly and entire families a good thing? They didn’t want the hostages to die as they are worth more alive, both for PR and for trade.

People who think Hamas are anything short of the worst scum of the earth are delusional and shouldn’t even be dignified with a discussion.

Imagine protecting naz**s because there was a nice guard in auschwitz ."
2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,"Her husband is still being held hostage. If she says anything bad, who knows what they’ll do to him."
2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,They have her husband still in custody. Of course she’s being “nice” to them. It’s fallacy

2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,"Important to add that her husband is still being held captive, so things she may be saying could very well be in part while under duress.

Wholly agreed that there is an absurd, massive effort to try and salvage Hamas’ reputation."
2,24/10/2023 14:30:47,She knows there are still hostages there and she is saying “peace” to the terrorist.  That’s the best possible thing to do in that situation.  Peace is her message.
3,21/10/2023 15:16:58,"I wouldn’t necessarily call them terrorist supporters but they definitely are biased, either against Jews, or in favor of Muslims. 

Amnesty once refused to have a campaign against antisemitism. They said that they preferred to focus on human rights more broadly, and not for any one specific group. 

This excuse later turned out to be a lie, when they had a campaign specifically against Islamophobia."

*Speaking in his final address to the UN Security Council on the Situation in the Middle East at the end of his ten-year term, Ban noted that ""In many cases, rather than helping the Palestinian cause, this reality has hampered the ability of the UN to fulfill its role effectively.""*

*""The Secretary General admitted the clear truth, the UN's hypocrisy towards Israel has broken records over the past decade,"" said Ambassador Danon.

Israel is not an apartheid state for the 20 per cent of its citizens who are Arabs. Israel’s Arab minority participates fully in the political process. Arabs in Israel have more fundamental rights than other Islamic and Arab countries in the Middle East.77 per cent of the Arab citizens of Israel say that they prefer living in Israel to any other country in the world.

Here's why the Amnesty report is a lie.

A lot of those organization wont try to find the information themself but ask someone who is part of the war. Thats how they publish propaganda when they think they showing the truth. One more thing, when you fight a terrorist  organization that ignore the rules of war and they dont even try to hold them acountable for their war crime but blame everything on one side, and that happened a lot when israel are is part of the conflict"

4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,"In Israel, yes, almost all are Arabs. 

However overall, when I look at the problem on a global scale, it seems that radical Islam is really the cause, not race. 

For example, Pakistan also has many terrorists and they aren’t Arabs. The Taliban also aren’t Arabs."
4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,It's a pointless agenda imo. It doesn't really help with anything. If someone isn't a terrorist and is innocent you do your best not to harm them.
4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,"Most people from Pakistan are inbred. Like 70%

Doesn't add anything to this, just a fun number to toss around. 

Terrorism is an idea for those who lack the means to be a military. Arab countries tend to suck at warfare. Mainly due to their outdated hierarchies and the loyalty problem of trusting your generals to take the army and not immediately overthrow you. 

Terrorists get obliterated in open conflict against better equipped and trained adversaries. that's why they seek to imbed and cause mayhem to larger opponents. Most often their home counties."
4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,This is the most racist post I’ve seen yet.
4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,"You may as well have written: While it's not true that all males are terrorists, it's undeniable that most terrorists are Male. This is an agenda that cannot be ignored, and it's essential to acknowledge the role that male individuals play in terrorist activities worldwide, or at least being in a spotlight more than others.

There was a study that showed Islamic religous observance was a terrible predictor of terrorist behaviour, the far better demographic to look at when trying to weed out terrorist recruits was young unemployed men with few prospects who reguarly played soccer."
4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,How do you classify terrorism? Look at what the US has been doing in the Middle East

The US let's take that opportunity to overthrow two countries government killing in the hundreds of thousands, displacing millions and install puppet government all for revenge and some oil... (Nothing extreme or radical there)

And plung entire populations into an extreme socioeconomic situation that leads to them to be radicalized but nope it's Islam...

4,15/10/2023 12:17:05,Let’s not forget the amazing IDF and their contribution in the last 70 years of terrorism against the Palestinians and human rights violations make up for all the statistical statements you mentioned above.

5,23/10/2023 01:23:10,"Hamas doesn’t really care about freedom for Palestinians, that’s just a side effect of its overall mission which is to bring Islamic revolution to the world. If Jerusalem falls they will likely look toward Spain or somewhere in Europe next. People that don’t understand this do not understand Hamas or similar Islamic revolutionary organization. They are hung up on fantasy narratives about the battle of Algiers that have nothing to do with the ambitions of these other terrorist organizations."

5,23/10/2023 01:23:10,"I agree the distinction is in their acts. Hamas would be militants if they had decided to go after military targets and start a rebellion to throw off their oppressor’s. 

They decided to go after soft civilian targets and shoot innocent people in n the street. That’s not the act of a military that is the act of a terrorist organization. 

They are terrorist point blank period. Then the question is if you find that justifiable or not. Which for me seems like a pretty easy answer. 

I don’t support terrorism."
5,23/10/2023 01:23:10,Unfortunately much of the media is anti Israel. These people hold no power and will have no impact on the annialation that will soon be unleashed. The media can spin all they like but the war will be fought and won with a fury these thug terrorists have never seen. The killing of women and children will prove to be biggest miscalculation these terrorist  thugs could ever imagine. We will dance on their graves very soon.
5,23/10/2023 01:23:10,"Interesting that you never hear reference to the Mafia or the Sinaloan Cartel as being ""international economic consortia.""

Words matter."

6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"It’s because leftists view everything with an American-centric view where everything is based on skin color. To them, Israel is a white colonial power and Hamas represents the resistance of the POC. If only they knew that a majority of Israelis are non-whites such as Sephardic and Ethiopian Jews."
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"I don't know... but leftists forget that muslims drove the Africans out of the North of their own continent, kicked Christians out of Lebanon, and expelled the Jews... they have no human rights in their own countries and behave like absolute savages, I stand with Israel and whatever happens to Palestine and the neighbouring Muslim countries is their own doing, you reap what you sow"
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"Adding on top of what other comments already mentioned here, it is also due to an orchestrated propaganda campaign by the USSR to shift Western audiences views against Israel.

And like every successful propaganda campaign, it feeds itself like a meme as time go on and people are very resistant to accepting that their views aren't organically theirs and that a part of it is brainwashing (even if indirectly).

These people will simultaneously think that even though the Palestinians elect Islamofascists and/or terrorists whenever given the chance, they can and should be able to be fully independent and without any supervision. Then in the next sentence they'll acquiesce that it's not such a bad idea that all the Muslims in the Arab countries around the area are ruled by despots, in the name of ""stability""."
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,Having support for the Palestinian people is not the same as supporting Hamas. It’s no different than being able to separate the Afghan people from the Taliban. And making generalized statements like leftists support them is like me saying in general that righties are racists that support the kkk and hate lgbtq. I’m sure you would hate for a handful to speak for the collective.
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"I don’t support Hamas but it’s worth noting that Netanyahu supported hamas for years.  And this isn’t some conspiracy theory, he didn’t vocally support them but worked indirectly with Egypt to make sure Hamas was still in existence.  It’s a divide and conquer approach to keep Gaza Separate from the West Bank, the Israeli government under his leadership never had intentions of peace or nonviolence.   This is why so many in Israel hate him."
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"There's a rift forming in the american democrat party.   The far left is very much pro-hamas and the moderate and center left is pro-Israel.

Hamas are  bunch of grubs."
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"It all dates back to when Nasser was in power in Egypt. 

Before this most leftists were very pro Israel even back in the mandate days when Jewish terrorist were bombing stuff, a lot of Jews came from East Europe and had socialist ideas so leftist loved them regardless.

Nasser's socialist ideas were coupled with Pan-Arab ideas and the two ideas spread through the middle East together. e.g. the Ba'ath parties in Iraq and Syria that wanted both socialism and a unified Arab state (that included Israel). Socialists in the middle East became more interested in the destruction of Israel just because Nasser was into Pan-Arabism. And all the far leftists in the world had to change their views on Israel"
6,15/10/2023 16:10:15,"Just remember Hamas was democratically elected.

The people that support Hamas generally don't understand what they are saying. It's a bandwagon issue and it's the flavor of the month to hate on Israel. I've seen people comparing 20 year statistics on Israel to what Hamas has done in a few days and saying ""See? Israel is worse."" When really, Hamas rivaled Israel's numbers in a few days, and are on track to pass them by ten times or more in a few months.

Israel has absolutely done some dirty stuff but they were never ""Parading naked and violated bodies around in pickup trucks"" bad. Hamas are savage terrorists and every country that matters is condemning them. And to be clear, yes I am saying that if a country doesn't condemn Hamas then it literally doesn't matter and should be ignored for the forseeable future. The adults are talking.

It is time to forget about who we ""hate"" and start focusing on the current issue. Hamas just committed one of the worst acts of terror in history, and they just gave Israel the green light to fully invade the Gaza strip and take it for good this time. And nobody in the world can say they don't have the right to do it now. Hamas is the official government of the Gaza strip. Democratically elected. This was an official act of war by a recognized government. HAMAS GOVERNMENT FORCES surrounded a music festival and slaughtered the concert goers. There is no more ""It wasn't our fault it was the terrorists"" because they ARE the terrorists."

8,02/12/2023 21:56:53,"We can have an argument for what is resistance and what an occupied people can do. The Palestinians have a right to resist their brutal occupation through many methods.

But, Hamas did not simply attack military targets. That would have been a very different equation. Not every Israeli is a legitimate target just because they're Israeli. 

Killing hundreds of innocents at a music festival is not resistance. Neither is killing old people in Negev kibbutzim. For all the Hebrew speakers in Hamas and their leadership, they should have known that most of these Kibbutzim are actually filled with the Israeli Left, the peace seeking leftists who would even consider living 1 km from Gaza.

None of this implies that Israel should level Gaza in retaliation or take revenge for Bibi's failure through killing Gazan children, but Hamas not being terrorists, simply based on their actions out of their own free will and even if it wasn't the initial plan, is just not something that I can personally accept as intellectually honest or true."

Hamas isn't defending Palestine or Gaza. They don't give a single fck about the people living there.

After enough shrieking Israel feels pressure to stop.

The difference now is that neither Israel, nor most of its supporters, is paying any attention to the shrieking (nor should they). Hamas killed more Jews on October 7 than any time since the Holocaust. Israel will destroy Hamas because it has to, regardless of the number of civilian casualties, and regardless of the media.

9,30/10/2023 17:53:26,"Historical context: Jews are indigenous in Israel. The Palestinians are an invention of Yassir Arafat. Both Jews and Arabs were mostly immigrants by the 1920ies. There have been several partition plans (1022, 1936, 1948). The Jews always agreed. The Arabs never did. There were also generous peace offers later from Barak and Olmert which were also rejected by the Palestinians. The Arabs have been trying to violently drive out the Jews for more than a hundred years, before Israel existed. 

To your question: 
Israel supplied Gaza for free for the sake of peace although it was under no obligation to do so. Israel has withdrawn from Gaza completely in 2005. Some Israelis had to be removed by force by the IDF. They left behind intact houses, horticultural businesses with greenhouses. The Palestinians destroyed all of it. They then elected Hamas who then wiped out Fatah members, preferably by defenestration. They put all of their resources into stockpiling weapons including digging up sewage pipes and repurposing them for rockets. The Hamas bosses are billionaires and live out of danger in Qatar. Hamas has a charter stating its goals. It’s worldwide Jewish genocide and a global caliphate. That means if they ever succeed in destroying Israel they’re coming for you!
The IDF serves to protect its citizens. They warn the citizens of Gaza through various channels of communication in Arabic to evacuate before they strike. Hamas hides I civilian infrastructure which is a war crime. They prevent the people evacuating by confiscating cars and IDs which is also a war crime. What they did to Israeli civilians (mostly Jewish but also other backgrounds including Arabs) should be enough for you to make up your mind as to whether they are terrorists. Here’s my opinion: 
Comparing those barbarians to animals would be an insult to animals. 
People who defend them are antisemites or very deluded."
9,30/10/2023 17:53:26,"Because they think storming peaceful communities, raping, maiming, torturing and slaughtering 1400+ innocents in less than 5 hours to the cry of ""Yahud"" (jew) is okay."

10,02/12/2023 22:02:45,You really need to read the international rules of war in the Geneva convention and Rome Statutes.  It's not like this scenario hasn't played out in virtually all military operations within a civilian area.
10,02/12/2023 22:02:45,"> Ask yourself honestly. If a school shooter was hiding in a school and using the kids as “human shield”, would the appropriate response be to blow up the whole school? People would loose their minds if that happened. Now ask yourself if a terrorist hid in your basement and the government blew up your whole family, would you be ok with that? A lot of pro Israelis are using the same logic as bin Ladin that if the people support a government then they are all responsible. It’s a sick thinking method.

In all of those instances, there are easier ways to get rid of the terrorist. you just enter the school or the basement and kill the terrorist.

With Hamas, you can't do this because Israel can't send foot soldiers to die the second they enter Gaza.

Not to mention it's not one small terrorist... It's a whole organization that does so.

And they don't hide in someone else's house, they hide in their own territory.

Not to mention that Israel didn't just blow up the territory for no reason - they asked the people to evacuate, if someone didn't evacuate - that's on him... 

So the situations are clearly not the same. 

Not to mention the Geneva convention literally states that it's allowed.

 

>Also there are many instances where Israel is blowing up places with no Hamas. And it wouldn’t even hurt Hamas since they are in the tunnels. It’s clear that Israel wants to kill civilians and destroy infrastructure. Israel is the same as !s!s..

How do you know there are no Hamas there exactly? No one can get in and check except for the people of Gaza - and why would they tell you there was a Hamas member there? 

As for the tunnels, you do know that the tunnels collapse under a missile strike, right? It's not a reinforced tunnel - built for standing everything. It's a bad tunnel that can collapse from pretty much anything...

It's also funny you compare Israel to ISIS considering Hamas literally carried Isis flags in the 7th of October massacre..."

Thousands of Russian speakers in Donetsk will be killed by Ukraine’s bombs. But it wouldn’t be Ukraine who made that choice to put them in a war and kill them. That would be Russians choice. 

A country can’t fight a war if they allow the enemy to use such exploits to be deemed invincible. Using civilians as shields is a war crime for a reason. The reasion is that they cause civilians to die."

Hamas planned, trained, and ultimately executed a plan to SPECIFICALLY target CIVILLIANS and kill, torture, and even rape as many of them as humanly possible, they threw babies into ovens on camera for F###s sake then they kidnapped 240 innocent people (babies, toddlers, men, women, holocaust survivors) as hostages and threatened to kill them on camera.

Israel on the other hand, in order to retrieve their hostages and ultimately eliminate the threat of Hamas, started taking out terrorist infrastructure by bombing Gaza, and innocent people were killed in the collateral damage. Yes, it's horrible and I wish I didn't have to be that way. Israel even warned civilians where they were going to bomb in advance and urged people to leave for safer areas.

It's war and people die in war, but make this stupid equivalence between a professional army actively trying to get civilians out of the way of their operations to get their own people back and an organization that willingly brought this upon themselves by killing innocent people unprovoked is completely outlandish. your mental gymnastics truly deserves a gold medal"

Your bizarro logic suggests that there's no difference between the truly innocent deaths the hijackers intend to cause (by slamming into a building and killing the passengers too) vs the nation shooting the plane down in self defense (causing regrettable deaths out of self defense). 

There's a difference here. Even if you pretend not to see it. 

There is no justification for what Hamas did on Oct 7, and in war there is no ""I placed my rockets next to a house, now I get to shoot at you forever and you can't defend yourself"" loophole."

Yes violence, retaliation is sometimes the last solution when a problem has not been addressed for many years or if it has not found ideal conditions. 

Still, there will be no peace until a political agreement has been found.

Terrorism has a cost. Palestines cowardly islamic terorrism is example like how they massacred the village, spared no one even a baby.

IDF is not terrorist, be­cause they didn't commit terrorism. Innocent Palestines died UNINTENTIONALLY as casualties or collateral damage from Israel messiles. You know Palestines terorrist planted their rocket launch in the Palestine residential areas right?

It was essential the soldiers knew that ""Terrorist"" isn't just an arbitrary term used and abused by our leadership.

So for us, the simple definition was whether someone targeted civilians as a standard operating procedure.

The more complex definition was whether an organization abided by the [Law of Armed Conflict](https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/law1_final.pdf), however it's surely more complex because there are different definitions and even conflicting agreements about these."

Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't have anything to do with whom you target. Targeting civilians is a war crime but it is not terrorism. 

Consequently, the Israeli army is not a terrorist army because it has uniforms. It doesn't matter if they eat babies for breakfast and fry puppies for lunch; they're still not terrorists. Conversely, Hamas members who do not wear identifying markers are terrorists. It doesn't matter if they only target kitten-murdering pedophiles who talk in movie theaters, they're still terrorists.

""Terrorist"" does not mean any illegitimate combatant. It has a very specific meaning, like any other legal term."

1) The use of violence short of war against civilian targets to change political opinion.

2) Violent actions by militias not in control of specific territory (i.e. not a government or guerrilla organization) as a means of exerting political pressure.

However, if you're fighting for the same cause and you're targeting civilians, bystanders, etc... you're a terrorist. That applies to everyone, regardless of whether you sympathize with their cause."
15,06/07/2023 23:20:29,"If Palestinian terrorists were fighting for freedom, there might be a case for discussion.

Far as I can see they’re fighting to end non-belligerent occupation to enable Islamist dictatorship."

16,02/11/2023 12:00:59,"Because what Hamas believes is more alike with what mainstream Muslims believe. Of course they support it - just look up ""the jews will hide behind the stones and trees islam"" on google. You will be shocked by what you see. It's an islamic hadith prophecy, commonly held by muslims and part of the hamas charter, that the muslims will kill jews and that when the jews hide behind trees even the trees will want them dead.

Muslims believe Momamed the warlord himself said this. And of course if child rapist modhamed said it then we gotta do it, it is god's will afterall.

And because white beta westerns refuse to believe it out of some irrational fear of being called racist and a brainwashed view that white people owe to themselves to give a pass to colored people literally no matter what because africans were enslaved here hundreds of years ago."
16,02/11/2023 12:00:59,"Because they don't see Jews as people, or civilians, so they don't believe killing them is terrorism."

I think you answered your question.  They pro-Palestinians (I'd say more likely BDSers here I think you are being overly broad) believe ""terrorist"" is a negative word, and they fully associate the random  slaughter of Jewish kids at a dance as a positive event and so reject the word on emotional grounds.  

> If you are Pro-Palestine, you should be against Hamas. Hamas had a chance to make Palestine at better place after Isreal ended their occupation, to choose the path of peace, but they chose war and corruption.

Sorry totally disagree with you. ""Pro-Palestinians"" have a long track record of not caring about Palestinians at all when Jews aren't involved.  Lebanon for example has horrific discrimination against ethnically Palestinian Lebanese.  BDS generally favor the policy.  We are going to here all day about the IDF bombing of a refugee camp.  When ISIS was tearing up the largest Palestinian refugee camp in the world, BDS were completely indifferent (and BTW don't let them play the ""nothing we can do"" they ignorant it was even happening even though supposedly their hatred of Israel is based on deep concern for Palestinians: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarmouk_Camp#During_the_Syrian_Civil_War). 

The reality is these guys detest Jews.  Hamas has similar attitudes towards Jews: no peace, nothing but never ending hostility till the end of time.  Certainly no two state solution that would legitimize Jews in their belief that they deserve a state.   What in Hamas would be there not to like?"
16,02/11/2023 12:00:59,Because they don’t really believe hamas did anything wrong
16,02/11/2023 12:00:59,"Depends. 
For Muslim supporters. It's part of their internal belief. If jihad is justified, how can Hamas be terrorists? They are doing Allah job. 

For others, it's mainly because the only framework they have is oppressed oppressor. Hard for them to see that there aren't just 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. But 1.2 billion Muslims vs 10 million people in Israel."
16,02/11/2023 12:00:59,"I suppose, because they believe that the Palestinian cause is just, and that due to the strength of Israel they believe they have no choice but to fight in a guerrilla way. There's usually some argument about how the IDF commit acts of brutality too.

>If you are Pro-Palestine, you should be against Hamas. Hamas had a chance to make Palestine at better place after Isreal ended their occupation, to choose the path of peace, but they chose war and corruption.

The tragedy of this conflict is that the longer it has gone on, the more violence and killing has been done on both sides, the more both sides have been pushed to the extremes. So you end up with ultra-right hawk types in power in Israel, and Hamas taking over from the PLO in Gaza. Then these types commit acts that further inflame the other side (rocket attacks, building settlements) and the vicious cycle continues."
17,15/10/2023 04:00:46,"Because with proper, unbiased research I think you’ll find that while Israel most certainly may have overstepped limits, it isn’t half as bad as the leftist FreePalestine movement is pushing. 

•The bombings are always done with a warning beforehand (evidence in my post history) which means that for years, Gazan deaths have been mainly avoidable. 

•Israel has provided for Gaza in a way that no neighboring Arabic country has- despite the aggression that’s been displayed by Palestinians no matter where they’ve taken up refuge. (Evidence in comment history, but also, please note how Egypt hasn’t so much as sent WATER.)

•Peace treaties have been offered REPEATEDLY and Palestinians are *always* the ones who leave peace talks despite which other countries are involved and what territory is offered.

… far too many other points to be made, but happy to discuss or send whatever unbiased links I can find if you’re also interested in the research."

And yet western politicians have time and again done nothing to intervene, done nothing to exert meaningful pressure. Worse, they have rewarded Israel with endless military, financial and diplomatic support."
18,29/10/2023 11:38:28,"If there was a way, the IDF would have done it.

Unfortunately, there is support for Hamas in a lot of Gazans household - we see that in videos of dead/unconscious Israelis being paraded in the streets of Gaza and being spat at and cheered.

Also, there are testimonies from ex-Gazans, the famous one is Dor Shahar (previously  Ayman Soubach) who has lived in Gaza and converted to Judaism. He explains that in every household in Gaza there is a Hamas terrorist. If you don't believe what he is, I can hear his Arabic accent very well when he speaks Hebrew. You can see an interview with him [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3RGVMAmTMk&ab_channel=DocumentingIsrael).

I would also like to add that although Hamas isn't very popular in the West Bank, over there there are more terrorist organizations such as Islamic Jihad and Fatah. But because the West Bank is occupied, they can't accumulate weapons like they did in Gaza. That's why it's ""more peaceful""."
18,29/10/2023 11:38:28,"Unfortunately it's very difficult to differentiate between Palestinian civilians who support hamas and don't. Too many stay silent, and there are many Muslim Israelis who actively cheer when rockets are fired and everyone's running to the shelters. Even the ones who don't support hamas at all are scared to speak out because of the pressures surrounding them, making it easier to support hamas by some sort of tribalism."
18,29/10/2023 11:38:28,Israel just need to build better defence inside Israel and maybe clear areas that are close to Gaza. Thats the real defence nobody is talking about. Everyone seem to believe the propaganda saying that attack is the same as defence which is totally wrong. No one is against israel defending themselves but invasion and bombing is not defence.
18,29/10/2023 11:38:28,"Considering that Hamas is the ""ruling party"" in Gaza etc, I doubt they even do a decent job of keeping records of who is or isn't a convicted criminal.  

One thing you can be certain of is that there won't be any LGBT Gazans left to ""separate"" into the west bank.  Hamas murders them all the moment they're ""caught"", and the people generally support this policy.  

So.. if the people in Gaza generally support a genocide of all LGBT people.. how would any of them be ""safe"" to have in the west bank?

Honest question."
18,29/10/2023 11:38:28,"Any Palestinian and Gazan who has no problem with the Israeli people must be mentally ill. Dissenting of settler Colonialism and understanding the people doing it are your enemies is not terrorism. Since this war, Israel has senseleslly killed ~100 people in the West Bank. Arab Israelis have been threatened by mobs and refused services. 

I'm so grateful that myself and the world have been awakened to the evil underbelly of Zionism."

18,29/10/2023 11:38:28,"The West Bank isn’t all that peaceful either. The Palestinian Authority is corrupt and ineffectual, and IDF has to go in and disarm the militants that pose a threat to the peace of Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank. The alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia was going to be an effort to impose more order in the West Bank, very much something Iran could not allow. Iran is desperate to become a nuclear power aligned with Russia, China and North Korea (FWTW). Israel will always be a hindrance to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, thus the hatred. The Palestinians are the pawns in the game to manipulate the West and a constant source of terrorists and violence. Authoritarianism is the rule in the Middle East because there isn’t a real grasp of democracy or freedom and whenever there is, the extremists show up to turn over the apple cart. The West may never figure this out because we are incredibly clueless about culture and history and human nature itself. Israel more or less gets it, but is constrained by the West and their own faith in democratic institutions."

They must be having a laugh at how stupid the people of the west are.

But you still ask if the IDF is a terrorist organization. As we are arguing with Hamas about whether they will be kind enough to let the red cross meet with women and children hostages that all their crimes were being in Israel (I won't even say ""being Jewish"" because they couldn't care less they were vicious to everyone)

October 7 was the end of any hope for a Palestinian state. I actually think that the Palestinian ""leaders"" secretly want that. They became billionaires and live in splendor, because of the misery of their people not despite it.

So when you support the Palestinian ""cause"" you're actually supporting the misery of the Palestinians.

It's a lesson that they will never learn and so 100 years from now if there is anybody left alive in the Middle East, they will still be a conflict.

I have a suggestion. Go ask a 17 years old kid to throw rocks at you and not stop until you lose consciousness. Do it every day for 2 years.

Then if you think that throwing rock can not deal a serious damage, I'll change my mind and respect your opinion about Israel's policy."

Article 19 overwrites the 18th about hospitals: if hospitals are used as military bases they can be bombed, even if there are civilians in. And that is applicable on any other building, UN, Church or Mosque, or any other thing, like ambulances. 

It wouldn't make sense if it applied only to hospitals, the Geneva Conventions are laws susceptible of interpretation, case by case. 

Yes, the IDF has killed many civilians, but they haven't done deliberately or willingly so. They tried all they could to protect the citizens of Gaza.

No. The IDF aren't a terrorist group and Mohammed Hijab is a delusional, islamist, Hamas fanboy, sphinctere-brain, bully to say IDF are terrorists with that confidence. Like anyone who thinks the same."
