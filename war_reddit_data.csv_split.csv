0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,"Reading comments here I couldn't comprehend how some people justify the killing of Israeli civilians. Just wow.

Because of the BS of the land being stolen?

As a Muslim, this makes me more Zionist than ever."
0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,They are killing kidnapping and raping civilians. They are going after civilians. Fuck them.
0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,I saw the festival video but had no clue they were being attacked and murdered. I just saw ppp running in a field trying to hop in cars
0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,"Kids and elderly will be kidnapped stripped and raped, the ongoing footage is astounding and i’m broken.
This is the end if any legitimacy for a Palestine, bye bye gaza"
0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,"Israel will bury and mourn their dead.
Gaza just buried their future. 
UN will shake heads and issue some resolutions.
Many redditors will still look at the real world as if it some Star Wars episode."
0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,"Well, I can see all sensible countries withdrawing any support for Gaza now. Most Arab countries are only interested in business, trade and making money. Throwing support behind the ignorant terrorists won't be continued. Hamas continually holding  their own people down by their actions."
0,07/10/2023 11:54:11,Im worried sick for my family i genuinely cannot sleep. My grandpa lives in be’ersheva and he is currently in his bunker. My family in TLV is hearing rockets all the time and im so scared something will happen to them. I know israel has their wrongs and as an israeli i am really sorry for that but we are not the government. We are just people. Palestinians and israelians are both people and i tried to distance myself from the conflict but its getting too much.

1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"I completely feel this, and as a Jewish person I feel so many conflicting feelings, guilt, protectiveness, grief. Having empathy for all the innocents is true empathy, no one but Hamas deserves to suffer and Netanyahu needs to go"
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"The primary reason why the war is tough to watch is because you *can* watch it.

This real time documentation of war started with Ukraine. And it’s only become more thorough and intense with Gaza. There is no other war in history that is documented directly to the public eye internationally, without first going through governments, to the excruciating detail that this one is.

Before modern moral standards of war, however imperfectly they may be followed, war used to be *far* worse than this."
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"the images have been haunting me too. i feel a responsibility to watch all the raw footage coming out of gaza to be aware of what my tax dollars are funding. but man. i’ve been having these horrifying nightmares where my limbs are blown off and i’ve been crying daily. seeing children in pain, while knowing they’ve run out of pain killers… no words. 

what crushed me irreparably was a video of a grandfather hugging the corpse of his granddaughter in his arms, gently opening one of her eyes to see them one last time, and then saying with the most gentle smile “she is the soul of my soul”."
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,Pump sea water into the tunnels!
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"Any war on civilian territory is tough (to the extreme) to watch. But when have we watched this before at this level? Never. The old adage about war being being televised comes to mind. Today, a war like this is snapped and tweeted from moment to moment on tiktok and insta. It's a whole different level. If this is any comfort, know this: if this ""war"" wouldn't be covered live by everyone interested with a cellphone in their pocket, the atrocities would make what's happening now look like extreme restraint, small in scale and motion. You don't wanna see past wars before they were captured and projected in media. You don't want to see.

This isn't a war on terror, I wouldn't even call this a war. It's a project. And it exposes human radicalization taken from theory land (schools and media) to action on the ground.
We are watching something new happening. This playground comes from the depths of hell."
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"This is such a reasonable position. Instead of demonizing everyone on the other side of the fence, you bring it down to the human level and show sympathy for innocent civilians in Gaza. Wish more people on both sides could think this way. Children are children."
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"After you see the same scene play out over decades, its effect lessens a bit. Nevertheless, these are the conditions of engagement that Hamas chooses. Hamas knows perfectly well how painful it is for most people to witness children suffering. Therefore, lacking military parity with Israel, they attempt to maximize the suffering of their own children -- and, more importantly, to HIGHLIGHT that suffering via all forms of media. The suffering is real, but Hamas has helped arrange it. It's not FAKE, but it is propaganda. Everybody knew perfectly well that Israel was going to cause immense damage to the north half of Gaza. There's no excuse for any children being there. Anybody with the slightest bit of intelligence and free will would have started walking south. This is a form of warfare that's a challenge to Western notions of the rules of war, but ultimately, one cannot dictate to an enemy force how they choose to fight. If they line up behind women and children, and march them in a line toward your guns, hiding behind them the entire way, and are prepared to engage once they're close enough, you really only have two choices: kill some women and children, or risk losing the battle (and potentially the war). There really are no other choices. The irony is that Hamas has all kinds of arguments about why Israel has committed ""war crimes"" or ""violated international norms"" or whatever. Hamas violates rules of war that even Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun decided were too cowardly. And yet they still claim to be ""men"" fighting for the dignity of their people."
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"I am an israeli and this situation and seeing how many people we kill is breaking my heart so much, there are no words to express the pain I feel due to the amount of destruction our goal to eliminate hamas is causing."
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,Well the US has asked nicely time to cut off our weapons which are being used to indiscriminately kill children.   Interesting how in the press conference the Israeli spokesperson could NOT answer the question of where people are supposed to go that’s safe.  The “detailed” maps left that part out.  All he could say is “safer”.
1,03/12/2023 08:04:48,"It's rough for all of us to watch if we have any capacity for empathy.  The difference between us and the anti-Israel crowd is that we acknowledge the truth that Hamas is morally culpable for these deaths.  

If Israel could help it, there would be zero civilian deaths.

Hamas deliberately maximizes civilian deaths on both sides.

And Israel holding their fire is not an option, because Hamas is not just *sitting* behind their human shields, they are actively launching rockets and planning more attacks on Israel. Doing nothing equal more civilian deaths.

Better to end this quickly and end Hamas forever."
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"I used to think that most pro-Palestinian activists around the world were just dis-illusioned into thinking that Hamas was a legitimate resistance organization that fought for rights and freedom. 

I was wrong. Too many of these activists know exactly what Hamas is and does and they support them regardless. It’s terrifying."
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"Hate to break it to you but the colors were already shown, people have been spamming ""death to Zionism"" under vids of Jews playing sports or whatever since social media first started. The only difference is it's louder than usual and more ""antiracists"" are using cognitive dissonance to justify it"
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"Amen to that! I’ve been progressive my whole adult life and used to be one of the people constantly critiquing Israel’s government and their treatment of Palestinians, but by god, the response from people on the left has left me rattled: ripping down hostage posters, chanting antisemitic slogans, trying to run Jewish people off college campuses… I hate to say but this entire thing has done a really good job of pushing my foreign policy beliefs to the middle. I’m so ashamed to be a zillennial  right now. 

We must take a stand against the antisemitism. Every day."
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"I never hear about the 240 civilian hostages held by hamas....30 days now....I hear about UN,ICHR,ICC,AMNESTY INT.,ETC all complain about Israel....let the hostages go!"
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"Why do people hate Jews so much? It's really bizarre. I've never seen Jewish people try and push their religion onto the public. They keep private and their religion seems to be passed down through ancestry. There is no Jews roaring into a megaphone on the streets or door calling to recruit people into their place of worship. I've never seen a Jewish suicide bomber and I've certainly never seen Jewish people cause chaos by planting bombs and shooting innocents. So honestly, I don't get what people's Problem is with Jewish people? 🤔

I know there are some Jewish extremists just like there's extremists in all religions who don't respect Christians and they spit at Christian people. I've seen a few videos circulating like that but personally I've never seen this behaviour in westernised countries. 
We've always just coexisted with our Jewish brothers and sisters where I'm from. 

The hate is really really messed up. There's haters are probably those weird as fuck holocaust deniers. 
One trip to any of the concentration camp museums and the soul would leave your body. 
Although I am a Christian man myself I've always loved my Jewish neighbours who live very close by to me. Swapping stories and traditions with each other has always been delightful. Never trust a person or company which allows such hate to be spread."
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"We live in 21 century, but still antisemitism exists. I don’t understand Palestinians/Muslims including people who live in Europe or USA were celebrating Hamas’ attacks on Israel. 
Even before Israel had not started to 💣in Gaza pro-Palestine protest rally erupted & after Israel starts 💣, protesters begin blaming Israel & the U.S. without any mention of horrific Hamas attacks even some news hosts started blaming Israel.  Hamas, which governs Gaza & voted by Palestinians slaughtered, burned alive, beheaded,  & kidnapped. Hamas knows how to get sympathy from people using children & mother and pro-Palestine supporters are out of control & disgraceful. Many of them don’t care about Israel nor Palestine.  They probably don’t know Hamas keeps asking to protest for Palestinians. It’s really bad the real victims are forgotten. I really feel sorry to Israel. It’s victim blaming since day 1."
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"I've seen so much hate for Jews become so normalized. I'm terrified for my Jewish husband, friends and family. Agree that this conflict has just highlighted peoples deep seeded hatred for Jews and now are loudly expressing it."
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,That hate is what the war is all about. It is also. The reason for a Jewish Homeland.
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"I am not Jewish but am used to getting hated since I'm a Republican in the States but watching the way all of this is unfolding has been crazy to watch.  I've done some light reading and finding out about how Palestine voted in Hamas back in the 2000s... there people seem to be split on support for Hamas or Fatah... watching Palestinians in the States blame the United States for this and me thinking ""Well, this is a war... bad things are going to happen..."".  I don't like war and it's horrible but looking back at the history of the country and the region it feels like this has always been a thing and even going into the 1800s to 1900s occupations, war and strife continued.  


Hamas terrorist attacks Israelis and barely anyone says a peep about that and even on US news it was a flash in the pan and then the retaliation took place and it feels like everyone is on the side of Palestine and Hamas even though 1/3 to 1/2 of Palestine supports Hamas and now discussions for yet another ceasefire and I'm in my 50s and remember how many times this has happened and lead ultimately to nowhere.  


Do people in Israel, as a generic question, basically feel like maybe just put an end to this and take over Palestine completely or do they think that will just lead to yet another ""the world deciding the fate of Israel/Palestine for them instead of themselves"" situation happening at the UN?"
2,06/11/2023 14:53:03,"If this entire 75+ year conflict was just about the Arab Palestinians having their own country, none of it makes sense.  If it's instead about using the Arab Palestinians as political pawns to attack Israel, then it all makes sense.  This is evidenced by:

-Egypt, Jordan, and Syria trying to TAKE land in 1948 against Israel.  They had no intentions of creating another Arab state.  They wanted to kill all the Jews and expand

-The rejection of every 2 state solution ever offered (5 that I know of), which would have created peace and given the Arab Palestinians self-determination and prime real estate.  Instead, the offers were not counter-offered, but met with violence along with the ""3 No's"", (No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with Israel)

-The insane amount of financial support from both Iran (the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism), and western humanitarian organizations.  Without a continual struggle against Israel, Iran would have no interest in funding their terrorism, and the west would send less humanitarian support.  Also, weapons manufactures enjoy selling both to the Arab Palestinians AND to Israel (the Iron Dome isn't cheap). There is a huge financial incentive to keep the suffering of the Arab Palestinians ongoing, and no financial incentive for peace"
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,"> For all of you that will say that when Palestinians will put their weapons down Israel will commit genocide, that’s nonsense, if Israel wanted, it would drop hundreds of thousands of bombs on all of the Gaza Strip and destroy every living soul within their borders, and a month would have been enough to do so.

That's a mindset I never understood.

""Israel's army is stronger, therefore if Palestinians didn't have an army you would kill them all"".

No. Israel's army is (a lot) stronger therefore if we wanted to kill them all they'd be dead already"""
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,"If Israel wanted to commit genocide,  the war would be over Oct 8."
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,"IDF dropped 30,000 tons guided bombs already. If they targeted civilians, the death toll should be one million or even more."
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,If this was a genocide the entire incompetent population of gaza would be dead already.
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,"I personally do not think that Genocide is the correct word for this. If you look at the most recent ""genocides"", none of what happened there is happening here. IDF soldiers are not marching civilians to fields and shooting them, they are not dumping bodies in mass graves, etc. What I do think is happening is that those in power view the Palestinians as a nuisance and can care less about their lives. So they can care less if women and children are killed as long as they manage to kill Hamas. They are basically using a sledgehammer to kill ants."
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,Israel wouldnt just totally bomb it. They need some inhabitible infrastructure too. And losing international support and aid will be bad for them aswell.
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,Israel could level Gaza and every Muslim country in 10 minutes with its arsenal of around 400 nuclear warheads but that’s not their goals. There will be a cease fire when Hamas is utterly destroyed. Just like the US destroyed Al Qaeda and ISIS. I don’t recall anyone calling on the American to do a cease fire because of civilian casualties.
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,Agreed. This is the conflict that will shape a totally new future for the middle east. I'm glad the Israeli government is not succumbing to international pressure.
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,"How many civilians have been killed in Gaza and could have Israel done it differently to save lives?   

Ok.  I’m pretty sure the numbers constantly being quoted which come directly from Hamas are highly inflated.  Maybe five times the actual number. Then how many of those were Hamas fighters?  How many were killed by errant Hamas rockets?   Could Israel have done things differently?   Possibly but at a great loss of Israeli soldiers and at a risk of not winning allowing Hamas to survive and attack again and again"
3,17/11/2023 20:45:36,">For all of you saying Israel is an apartheid state that discriminates Palestinians, that doesn’t make sense because all Jews that lived here before 1948 are technically Palestinians too. Oh and it’s also not an apartheid state because every citizen gets equal rights, and it’s literally in the constitution.

It is an Apartheid as classified by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch

Nelson Mandela had repeatedly highlighted how Palestinians struggled under a similar colonial Aparthied system as South Africa

https://youtu.be/i5TiUhhm7cQ?si=owwqWTBIR2KzN8I_

Mahatma Ghandi, Malcolm X, and Einstein all condemned the Israeli occupation of Palestine and supported Palestine's struggle for freedom."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"We will take control over Gaza, the Gazan education system and the Gazan religious centre's and transform the people in Gaza from jew hating anti-Semites who want to destroy us into people who want to be Israel's friend while also standing up for freedom and democracy.

The need to do the same as the allies used denazification in Germany. Remove the thoughts of hating us, make sure the Gazan imans won't preach anti semitism in their mosques. And have some sort of system with undercover police to make sure there won't be underground anti-Semite centres. Even censor the internet if need be.

Of course Israel has to make sure Gaza is thriving so it won't feel like some ghetto. They should have the same living standards as we do. Tough I fear the wall has to stay up for the first 20 years. 

This is a process that might take a century to truly complete. But whenever we can trust the Palestinians and the Palestinians at the very least don't have a wet dream of destroying us. Then there can be talks of making Gaza an independent nation.

These are drastic measures, but doing anything else will just result in the next 7-10 and more violence by both Palestinians and Israel."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"The UN shouldn’t be involved in anything. They definitely knew Hamas was using their schools and hospitals as military bases and actively kept providing resources for Hamas to keep doing so, rather than taking action.

Then they kept denying it until Israel uncovered it all and then their excuse was “Well yeah, I guess we knew, but we were only responsible for what happened above ground”.

Along with WHO, the UN should be held responsible for this entire tragedy. They are disgraceful.

The Palestinians should also never get independence, they have proven time and time again that they don’t want peace and prosperity and will not accept anything less than the destruction of Israel and murder of Jews. After, October 7th, they’ll be lucky to even get a return to the previous status quo. Israel will be kind to even give them limited autonomy. The Palestinians aren’t the Germans or Japanese who want to reform and progress after war."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"1. It will probably happen 

2. We'll see about UN or another group...UN organizations in Gaza are proven to be terror organizations funded by the UN. 

3. Yeah , that's how this problem started. 

4. Rude to even suggest it. Israel is a democracy and will choose its own leadership. I think most Israelis will want Netanyahu to resign, and he will probably lose an election, but that won't be to any international decision but the Israeli people decision. 

5. Yeah, like UNRWA? UNICEF? Terror organizations funded by the UN. 


Btw , I'm cynical here about most points just because most of them already happened and brought this war. 

Obviously, the solution will need to be related to the points with some adjustments - for example , there will be an international body that governs - it won't be the UN. Israel has zero trust in the UN - especially after 10/7 and the discoveries in Gaza."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"The UN is useless, their only role should be basic security. Like a Gaza police force.

Israel will have to get rid of the Netanyahu government before any serious work can begin. Once Israel gets a more moderate government in place, they should work with more moderate Arab countries to temporarily govern Gaza while they rebuild and identify potential local leaders who actually care about building a peaceful, prosperous future for the Palestinians. Once they get that, we can get rid of the PA in the WB and actually think seriously about peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"Problem with the UN being involved is many members are antisemitic. That is a fact. If I were Israel, I would not trust them to take a neutral position."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,">1) A buffer zone between Israel and Palestine.

Already planned, and really should have happened a long time ago, Egypt has one that is 10 meters wide and 9 meters deep (they also planned to flood it but didn't).

>2) UN troops ensure the remaining Hamas fighters are disarmed and the tunnels are destroyed or flooded, all under Israel's supervision.

UN wouldn't do shit, they neglected checking what is being taught by the teachers they hire at their own funded schools, they stayed silent about the rape of women for almost two months (and their response was laughable), they ignored that one of their local reporters knew about the massacres planned and even joined them, they said nothing about how one of their doctors held one of the hostages, and they are biased in so many levels they aren't even trying to be impartial.

The UN is a joke, their forces were attacked in Lebanon by Hezbollah at the start of the war and had to flee, and they are mostly unable to help in any form in an armed conflict..... 

The UN is no longer to be trusted.

>2) Palestine becomes independent and there are elections.

There isn't a way that Palestinians gain authority and turn it into a successful country, not with the current mentality, and probably for many many years to come. 

Also, you don't do what was done in 7.10 and be rewarded with autonomy, they don't get autonomy until they reject their dream of destroying Israel. 

>3) Netanyahu resigns.

Yep, most of the people in Israel want him in prison for his negligence........

>4) The UN is committed to building schools and infrastructure by directly commissioning foreign companies, e.g. Indian ones.

What for? The UN and other organizations built schools and hospitals, schools where they teach antisemitism and hating jews (paid by the UN) and hospitals where they host terrorists and take hostages and lie about the actions done inside them."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"> A buffer zone between Israel and Palestine.

There isn't a lot of land. Unless you intend to move one or the other population it isn't easy to create a meaningfully sized buffer zone.

> UN troops ensure the remaining Hamas fighters are disarmed and the tunnels are destroyed or flooded, all under Israel's supervision.

What makes you think the typical UN force has the operational capability to deal with Iranian supported groups?  

> Palestine becomes independent and there are elections.

Hamas at this point would easily win fair and free elections.  Additionally Palestine isn't getting independent for a generation.  

> Netanyahu resigns.

He is likely to get voted out.  But Netanyahu is not the problem. 

> The UN is committed to building schools and infrastructure by directly commissioning foreign companies, e.g. Indian ones.

That's UNRWA, it already exists.  They worked to deepen and prolong the conflict."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"1. Buffer zone.. a fat one at that.. like the Korean DMZ..
2. Nothing Hamas should be left standing.. let alone disarming.
3. Yes.. that's ideal.. but it also needs to be made sure that nothing like Hamas comes out at the top. Elections can be done with international observers making it clear that no one comes around later and claim election fraud.
4. Not sure.. that's for the Jewish public opinion to decide 
5. As it has done nothing good till this point, it should invest in reconstruction to save face."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,"Among the Palestinians:

1. UNWRA should cease to exist, that’s a radical antisemitic organization and the UN just doesn’t supervise it. More than 50% of the Hamas terrorists learned in UNWRA and many UNWRA teachers are spreading antisemitic things on social media.

2. The “Palestinian-loving” Arabs should handle Gaza, Israel won’t handle 2 million radical Palestinians (yes… all of them are radical, they were educated by Hamas and the PIJ). 

3. The PA should undergo significant changes, their textbooks are explicitly antisemitic (they don’t even try to hide it), and they’re too focused on the false “Zionists stole our land” narrative which only increase the radicalism rates among the Palestinians population. They should recognize Israel as a **Jewish state** and stop with their bs.

4. After the Arab states de-radicalize the Gazans and the PA underwent the required changes, the Gaza Strip will pass to the PA maybe peace negotiations should start, depending on the efficiency of that.

Among the Israelis:

1. Changing government policies into more peace-oriented, fortunately after the war the coalition will fall and there will be new elections, hopefully Gantz and Lapid will start the new coalition. 

2. Freezing settlements construction and recognizing the hilltop youth as a terrorist organization, at the same time demolishing some smaller settlements. 

3. Getting ready for the Palestinians to done their process, if it was effective then start peace negotiations."
4,04/12/2023 07:55:21,Saudi Arabia and Qatar should be the administrative powers of Gaza and rebuild the area and de-radicalize the population. UNRWA should be dismantled. Israeli elections will be held (and Bibi will lose).
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"1) god I hope not the UN they are the most biased untrustworthy organization on this earth, influenced by the most exremely radical countries on earth.
I would say Egyptian control is better, even Jordanian or possibly Saudi control would be better, Arabs can’t be controlled by the west and we need an Arab country with stakes here and not a bad actor.

2) Palestinians don’t want democracy and aren’t capable of democracy at this point, maybe if you let the West Bank PA control but that’s also not gonna work probably and will end up in a mess, the worst thing the west always does is assume everyone want democracy or is capable of it.
There are no Arab demoacies for a reason, the west can’t comprehend that and that’s the biggest failure of the left, they can’t fathom this simple fact.

3) I hope we can get to that point, but there would have to be demilitarization of Gaza, no guns let in apart from a police force to monitor the strip, that’s the only way Israel accepts it and also monitoring shipments.

4) agreed


5) never, Israel is already a democracy and will not accept influx of Muslim immigration, “right of return” is de facto making Israel a Palestinian state

6) also no, democracy doesn’t work with reserved seats, that’s just another Lebanon situation, see how well that worked out for them.

7) Israel should also help rebuild


Also Israel isn’t yet close to winning anything, let’s start with the fact that no one wins in wars, both side lose.

But on a more practical approach, Israel hasn’t begun the tunnel metro elimination which will be a terrible thing and probably very costly in life."
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,Looks good on paper but you have to understand the Arabs in control don't want peace they want israel to not exist
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,As an Israeli I do not want to share a country with the people of Palestine. I do not mind a two state solution but I will not be living with people who celebrated the slaughtering of innocent families.
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"I think this is some of the dumbest shit I’ve ever read, Israel should win a war and then surrender? No, Gazans go to Egypt, West Bank Palestinians to Jordan. No more, this is the last straw. All Palestinians gone from Israeli lands."
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"1. Not gonna happen, the UN is worse.
2. Maybe
3. It’s not a blockade it’s border control. But it won’t end.
4. Why?
5. Start: Makes sense. End: That’s the end of Israel, and the Jews.

7. Maybe"
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"You can't lose many wars (that you started) over 75 years, commit terror attacks non stop, fire rockets, terrorize civilians then expect to be rewarded after all this. Ain't gonna happen."
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"1. International control yes. Not the UN since history proves they have no power and they evict their forces when thinks get rough. There would have to be a govern body that allows the IDF to make sure terrorists won't get armed again. Kinda how it works with PA in the west bank 
2. Yes. What will you do if they choose a terror organization like they did when they elected Hammas in 2006? Honestly, don't know what is the solution for that.
3. Agree and it would probably happen ones Hammas is defeated, since the blockade only started after hammas gained power. But Israel must be sure they are not getting armed again by iran.
4. Stop settlements yes. Not sure who do you mean should receive dual citizenship. The Jewish settlers? The Palestinians?
5. Israel has no law that discriminated between citizens from different races. Why guarantee Palestinen ""right of return"" if they work towards their own state? Even if you think it was not justify that they lost their homes after 1947-1949 war (not getting in to that debate), it was 75 years ago, most of Palestinians have never been there. Most Israelis, and milions of people around the world are descended of refugees and don't have the right to return to their ancestors' home. 
6. Why would they need reserved sits? Arabs form 20% of Israel population and they are free to choose their own representation without a party having a reseved sit. They need to show their people that they are working for them to get elected. And how do you choose the party that gets those sits? They are currently 3 arab parties, one of them is joint with jews. Are you suggesting that arabs would only be allowed to choose an arab party?
7. Definitely. It is obvious to almost all Israelis.

What you are actually suggesting is two states - one Palestinen for Palestinians, and Israel for both Israelis and Palestinians. so essentially two states solution with no Jewish state. This ""solution"" is not on the table."
5,06/11/2023 09:00:39,"This is incredibly naive. If they have elections they’ll just elect Hamas or whoever their stand in is again. They’ll force the U.N. out and rearm to genocide the Jews “From the river to the sea” the only reason denazification worked was world wide disgust with what Germany did. Unfortunately too many clueless people in the west and full throated support in the Muslim world celebrating the culture of death and death to the Jews. I don’t have a solution but I suspect the real solution comes when there is a wider regional war and sadly either the Jewish communities cease to exist or the Arab communities cease to exist (in broad strokes, I presume either way some token minority will be preserved). It’s depressing but it is reality."

That points 1 to 3 are good, 4 is far fetched 5 and 6 are irrelevant, and 7 is not something that Israel prevents

The Palestinians (at least in the strip) cannot be trusted, there are multiple accounts of them violating the trust Israel gave them (some of the murderers had working visas for example) I have another set of points if you will

1) a ten year (or other finite number of years) millitery control over the strip like in the WB (maybe even partitioned to A B C areas) because the WB terrorists could never have made an action like that I  this scale

2) complete demolish and rebuild of northern Gaza to destroy the terror infrastructure 

3) offer families (not individuals) the option to relocate to other countries that welcome them with the financial aid of Israel (and America would probably pitch in as well) 

4) issuing a death sentence tailored particularly for Hamas members and people that took part on black Saturday to prevent future attempts to do similar things 

5) complete reform in the Palestinian education system"

'''Few things get me more irritated than supporters of group that starts a major conflict and, when it becomes apparent that it’s not going how they planned, suddenly become super concerned about things like “the children” and call for an immediate cease fire.

Centuries of human conflict have repeatedly demonstrated that, if you start something, you’d damn well better able to finish it or suffer the consequences.

Most of these Palestinian protestors who now so desperately want a cease fire are just upset that Hamas wasn’t able to sustain their success and are now paying the price. If the IDF was in ruins and Hamas forces were steadily advancing towards Tel Aviv, I guarantee they’d all be doing something else on this fine afternoon in London than calling for peace.

Same f-ing story for the last 75 years: launch a surprise attack, then play the victim when Israeli hits back infinitely harder. Crap, even Egypt figured out that it was a stupid game to play and got out 45 years ''''"

8,26/10/2023 16:50:34,"1st, wars are never ""fair"" there is always one side stronger than the other that's how wars are won. 

2nd, hamas should have thought about Israel having good defense before they went on a killing spree of babies, women, elderly and all other civilians. 

3rd, Hamas is to blame for all destruction on both sides. Hamas can't be hiding behind civilians, hospitals and mosques and then prevent them from leaving. Sole responsibility for destruction is hamas.

Also, don't take my word for it. Listen to the son of one of the founders of Hamas.

8,26/10/2023 16:50:34,"The truth of the matter is we are holding Israel and Hamas in two completely different standards. It's not a bad thing. We already established that Hamas is terrorist and Israel is government of the modern world. Of course we will expect Israel to act differently from Hamas moving forward. 

If they're allowed to do whatever they want and they are held at the same standards as Hamas, this war could have ended the week it begun. But instead we made them turn water and power back on, we made them allow aids go through, throw flyers around, be subjected to UN monitoring, etc. Hamas did none of that and there is no body that Hamas has to answer to (except Iran lol).

Both are in the same war, playing with two different set of rules. I'm worried that Israel would get sick of it eventually. But if they act like Hamas as well, then it would be a really bad time to be alive still in Gaza."

From mutilations, beheadings, humiliation, chanting slurs and “Allahu Akbar” accompanied by islamic references with every terrible act, to the weird Hollywood style “military” montages showcasing their “heroism”, err,, barbarism, they did it all by the book.

I got one disagree. 
Hamas are terrorists. No better than ISIS.
This is not my view on normal Palestinians.
I do know Israel had plenty of rape and murder cases against Palestine to which proof can also be found on telegram. Although less as many are smart enough not to film it.
I just wish both sides (this does not include terrorists or ultra national extremists who use violence as a tool)  would accept that they have to share the land and live together in mutual respect for tradition’s and cultural differences.

Why aren't we talking about the wisdom of invading Gaza? I think it's dumb. The Israelis will be ground up fighting in an urban environment. The people calling for Gaza to be turned into rubble don't remember Mount Casino. Rubble makes for great defenses. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has promised to invade from the north as soon as the IDF has committed it's forces to Gaza. An intifada in the West Bank is inevitable if Hezbollah and Hamas are both fighting.

Bibi is a BUM. He failed to protect the Israeli people and now we know it's because of his corruption. He's got to go. Why he is allowed to remain in charge after his continual failures and failed strategies is a mystery to me."

Either way Hamas  showed they were getting to strong and must be dealt with. Egypt didn’t open their borderes to help the palestians. No one thinks palestian lives are worth less it just that you can’t avoid them not dying in this type of war but it’s not Israel’s intent to kill innocent palestians. I don’t even think this ends with Hamas. Hezbollah war is going to happen too. Remember Hamas killed Israeli Muslims with hijabs during this attack.

12,30/10/2023 17:15:29,"The problem is that you cannot destroy an idea.

The Palestinians believe that their lives would improve if Israel stopped bombing them, making them stop at checkpoints, or raiding the Gaza Strip and making settlements.

They are taught that Israel citizens are settler-colonists that displaced them from their homes and are conducting genocide on their people through various policies.  They believe that getting rid of Israel is simply reclaiming what is rightfully theirs And preserving their livelihoods.

Even if they die in battle, they believe that as long as they fight the enemy, they will be rewarded by Allah in heaven.

The Arabic countries want a Middle-East free of Western meddling and full of Islamic countries like in their Golden Age.  

Hamas and other groups are born from these ideas and beliefs.  They are many issues in the Middle-East not caused by Jews like with Great Depression Germany, but it is simply easier to blame the Jews for all the problems.

Hamas is the major problem for both Israel and Palestine, but they would rather destroy the country themselves than give up power and surrender.  Even if Hamas is gone, the discontent that gave rise to them will still exist.  Many Palestinians already died after 10/7, they will inevitably blame Israel and attack them again.  

It is possible to create a peaceful Palestine state but it would require completely rehauling their leadership, education, and society from ground up like in Japan and Germany, which would be seen as too imperialistic by the UN and other Muslim countries.  A neutral mediator is needed to maintain peace between Israel and Palestine, but no one right now can be trusted to be impartial in this conflict.  Therefore it continues.

What a tragedy."

13,13/11/2023 14:55:24,"Overly optimistic. All Hamas terrorists have probably fled to the south, which is now crowded. Gazan people from the north has nowhere to go. Israel can't tell the population to clear the south now and move to the north. It won't be easy to crush the rest of Hamas and reach the hostages. One of the tunnels uncovered today had a vertical  entry 20 meter deep. We don't know the details of the military advance, but it is by no means an easy one. Never was.

Honestly, I think many more Palestinian people are terrorists than we think. I see them carrying machine guns on funerals on the street. Where did those weapons came from? 
There is this idea of a restrict group of very evil people among a large peace and loving population. Yet at least 3000 Palestinians entered Israel on the seventh of October, and as soon as they crossed the border back, they were met with crowds helping them carrying the hostages. We are easily talking about some 10000 people directly involved the massacre."
13,13/11/2023 14:55:24,I’m a Palestinian that advocates for peace and I’m happy to see that the civilians are being brought to safety and that Hamas will soon meet their END. For all that is good in the world we need these evil forces to be brought down permanently.
13,13/11/2023 14:55:24,"Yeah, ""You sow the wind, you reap the storm"" is one very simple way to put it. Hamas needs to be stopped, just like islamism, shar'ia and governments of most Islamic States, especially those who beat girls to death for one lock of hair showing off the veil on their heads. But it is mostly their people who should rebel to this in the first place, making people hear their voices loud.

14,22/10/2023 13:25:34,"Is it just me or whenever a Muslim terrorist does something bad no Muslim ever speaks up. Has anyone said publicly hamas was wrong for taking hostages? No! Muslims go directly to play the victim card and post bs on social media spreading so much propaganda and false information. Any time a Muslim does something bad to someone else they are supported by their fellow Muslims. In the Quran there’s a statement that says A worst sinful Muslim is better and superior than the most righteous Kafir (kafir meaning non muslim). 

Another statement in the Quran the directly makes fun of Jews : And you will certainly find that the people most hostile against the believers are the Jews and the ones who ascribe partners to Allah (5:82) 

Last but not least: The Messenger of Allah was asked, ""What is the best of all acts of worship?"" He said,
""Believing in Allah"" He was asked, ""And then what?"" He responded, ""Jihad in the path of Allah"" Then he was asked ""And then what?"" He said, ""An accepted Hajj"" Bukhari and Muslim]


All these false fake sympathy posts and acts of crime are all due to how intolerant Islam as a religion is.

They do the same thing to justify the Oct. 7 massacre. They’re not happy with WB settler violence, and settlers are Israeli, so… Israelis were justifiably killed in their minds. 

It’s disgusting and lazy."
14,22/10/2023 13:25:34,"Hamas uses Islam to justify its atrocities against the Jews, that’s why. Well, that, and a nasty combination of willfulf ignorance and outright prejudice."
14,22/10/2023 13:25:34,I would assume most of the Muslims who are really into this support the goals of hamas.
14,22/10/2023 13:25:34,Because of Propaganda. Muslim leaders all around the world profit from the narrative that muslims have to stick together against the evil outside world.

Also, there is no evidence of a ""carpet bombing"". It is a ""precision bombing on militant targets."" Yes, you can die in a precision strike. Still, it's the best thing Israel can do to remove Hamas while minimizing civilian casualties. The Deaths in Gaza are 50 times lower compared to Syria and Yemen, that is happening right now. I haven't heard any denunciations of Assad or Bin Salman as of recently. If you really care about Muslims, Donate to the Yemeni or Syrian cause, not Gazans because that just allows Hamas to confiscate more food and allows them to hide longer."

First, there is no displacement at all. Nobody is forced to evacuate, it's a choice. Of course if your home is used for terror and you want to live, you better evacuate, but you don't have to. 0 people have been displaced so far.

Second, collective punishment stands for a penalty or sanction given to innocent civilians. Killing/siege/not donating food or water and not allowing aid do not fall under these categories. Examples of collective punishments would be to give each Gaza civilians a 500$ fine, or to order all Gaza civilians to do community work, or go to jail etc...

(Delibrately) killing civilians, or starving civilians to death fall under other war crimes. Though neither of this seem to be the case in this war."

-  Bombing of civilian infrastructure
- Carpet bombing of civilians who were in their homes (arguably genocide) and killing 11,000 most of them women and children; Denying proper funerals
- Use of white phosphorus 
- Bombing of schools, hospitals, refugee camps
- Cutting off food, water, fuel and supplies (causing disease and starvation)
- Open firing at innocent civilians, especially children
- Bombing churches and other religious places
- Denying supplies to hospitals
- Killing doctors and journalists
- Bombing civilians while they're trying to evacuate as per IDF orders
- Stripping and urinating on people who were detained illegally

The list is endless. This is a fight between two terrorist organizations - Hamas and IDF."
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,"I agree with a lot of what you said but this type of rhetoric isn’t helpful. I understand you’re emotional about it, but we need practical solutions. 

Cutting off the food and water won’t do anything except make Palestinians more sympathetic to Hamas. Hamas does not care what happens to the hostages and they certainly don’t care about their own people. The restriction of aid is great propaganda for them because decent people, such as myself, also feel bad for Palestinian civilians. 

The marches aren’t in favour of terrorism necessarily. The majority of people just believe that Palestine deserves a state and they know very little about the conflict. They don’t know how many times the leaders in Palestine rejected the creation of a new state. War is hell, but we must not lose our decency trying to seek revenge. 

Even if you don’t care what happens to Palestinians (I do) it is very bad if the international community turns against Israel. They are surrounded by hostile neighbours. Iran has threatened to escalate the situation and they are dealing with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Solve the situation in a smart, not emotional way."
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,"Whatever rights the Gaza civilians should have (air,food,water) the innocent hostages should have those rights too."
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,"And let’s not forget that they could have and should have had their own water and electric. Their elected government got plenty of aid but chose to spend it on weapons. Pipe meant for water was used for bombs, concrete meant for buildings was used for Hamas tunnels. When Hamas drove back with child hostages and dead bodies, I saw citizens cheering them on and spitting on the dead bodies. They knew what Israel’s response would be and chose to take that risk. They could have had water sooner if they released some hostages but chose not to. If you support terrorists and condone and cheer their brutal actions then you shouldn’t be surprised when it comes back at you tenfold!!"
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,"There hasn't been an election since 2006 - 17 years ago. Most people in Gaza did not, in fact, vote for Hamas. Almost half weren't even alive then."
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,Worth noting that Hamas only won the election because Fatah stupidly ran multiple candidates for the same seat
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,"Hamas was elected, but they also seized power and kill anyone who vocally oppose them. They have not had elections for decades. Claiming they are the elected representatives is not a fair claim. 

That does not diminish Israel’s right to protect itself. Hamas is still the government of Gaza. They are at war and there is no moral equivalence between those two states and their stated goals. But Hamas abuses their own people as well. To claim they are elected representatives is nonsense. ."
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,What is 700?  You are confusing the Palestinians with Hamas.  It's like bombing Los Angeles to eliminate the Crips ... slight overkill.

16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,"What is the end game????

Let's say that Hamas is victorious. Israel no longer exists. What would life look like for the Palestinian population? 

The save governing body that used children as human shields will all of a sudden start investing in infrastructure for its people? The same neighboring countries that refused entry for the Palestinian people and decided to martyr them for their anti-semetic agenda will now embrace them as neighbors?

No. There will be no freedom for these people if Hamas wins. There will be no prosperity. The neighboring countries will invade this land, just as they tried to do when it Israel was established. Maybe it will be Egypt, or Jordan, or Lebanon, or maybe all together. 

Hamas will then turn on the rest of the western world, targeting Europe and the United States next, emboldened by their victory over Israel. 

There is no end game here while Hamas remains active. Frankly, I will go as far as to say that Islam, in general, is a danger to Western civilization.

This is why it is important to support the only country in the Middle East that shares Western values."
16,16/10/2023 03:15:23,Half of the population couldn't even vote in the election in which Hamas narrowly won. Moreover the indiscriminate bombings of Dresden in WW2 are widely considered to have been immoral yet that was against the Nazis. Your foe may be evil but the civilians are not.

17,16/10/2023 09:29:33,"A History Lesson for the FREE PALESTINE, social media ""warriors"" 
Educate yourself.


Debunking the Palestine Lie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7ByJb7QQ9U   

1. “Israel kicked Palestinians out of their homes in Sheikh Jarrah.”
No one was locked out of their homes. A decades-long court case of homeowners vs tenants who didn’t pay rent concluded that the tenants needed to pay rent to the owners of the property, (bought and documented in 1875 to live near the burial ground of the 4th c. BCE Jewish leader Shimon Hatzadik,) or leave.

2. “Israel took over Al Aqsa.”
Al Aqsa is in Israel. It also ""happens"" to be built on the holiest site in Judaism - Temple Mount. Despite this, Israel gave administrative control to the Jordanian Waqf, while Israel maintains security control. In turn, the Waqf doesn’t allow Jews to pray on Temple Mount - our holiest site. Israel did not take over Al Aqsa, nor did it threaten to. However, it has been used for years by Islamist radicals as a place of storage for boulders and rocks to hurl at Jews and other worshippers at the Western Wall below, as well as at security forces. Israel is the only place in the Middle East that guarantees and protects freedom of worship for all faiths, while having to take serious security threats into consideration.""

3. “Israel maintains an illegal occupation.”
Arabs rejected the 1947 partition, thus never forming a country in the allocated territories. From 1948 to 1967 Gaza and West Bank were occupied by Egypt and Jordan, respectively, with 0 protests from the UN or Arabs living in those territories. Neither county granted citizenship to the vast majority of Palestinian Arabs, preferring to leave them in refugee camps and weaponizing generations against Israel. In 1967, tiny Israel was simultaneously attacked by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, with assistance of Iraq, Lebanon, and armed by the Soviet Union. Miraculously, Israel came out victorious, while Jordan, Egypt, and Syria fled. Israel, despite having been attacked, offered to returned ALL of the land in exchange for peace, rejected by Arab league in Khartoum.
The territories in question are not occupied, but remain disputed under international law.
In 2005 Israel completely evacuated from Gaza, removing 8,000 Jews from their homes, in hopes that Gaza would become a peaceful Palestinian state. There is no Israeli presence in Gaza (even Jewish cemeteries had to be exhumed!). Greenhouses and other infrastructure left for Palestinians to use was torched by Arab mobs. Within a few months, internationally recognized terror organization Hamas, funded by Iran and dedicated to the murder of all Jews and total destruction of Israel, came to power. It has brutally suppressed freedoms, investing most of its resources into weapons, rockets and terror tunnels, instead of improving lives of its people.

4. “Israel builds homes in the West Bank.”
There have always been Jews in the West Bank - it’s literally called Judea and Samaria because it’s the Biblical heartland of the Jewish history and where the Jews are from. It's where Kings Saul, David and Solomon started the Jewish monarchy in the 9th c. BCE, where the Jews retuned to from Babylonian exile in the 5th c. BCE, where the Chanukah events occurred in the 3rd c. BCE, where some of the holiest and most important Jewish texts of Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud were completed in 2-4 c. CE, where Maimonides kissed the ground in the 12th c., where waves of immigrants fulfilled their dreams to return to their home from all over the world in all eras, be it 18th c. Chassidic Jews, 16th c. Spanish exiles, or 5th c. Talmudic sages.
Even since the 1850s, Jews were the majority population in Jerusalem. Expecting Jews to leave is expecting ethnic cleansing of Jews from the Holy land where we’ve always lived.

5. “Israel maintains a siege in Gaza.”
That’s literally impossible, since Gaza also has a border with Egypt.
Israel maintains security borders like any other country. You must have a visa to enter, and people from Gaza get plenty of visas when needed. Due to Gaza’s tendency to import rockets which are used on Israeli citizens, Israel blockades arms shipments and inspects all imports at the border, allowing all safe materials through, including providing water, electricity, and tons of daily food supplies and other essentials.

6. “Israel started it.”
PA/Fatah leader Abbas, now in the 17th year of his 4 year presidency term, canceled the long-anticipated elections just weeks ago and decided to escalate violence against Israel as a perfect distraction. Hence, weeks of dozens of violent tic-toc filmed assaults on Jews in Jerusalem, encouraging violent rock throwing riots at al-Aqsa through Ramadan, and taking credit for a drive by murder shooting on three Jewish youth, one of whom died. Then an eviction case was used to fuel more unrest.
Not to be upstaged, Hamas and Islamic Jihad had to tap into its upgraded rocket arsenal to be seen as champions of al-Aqsa. NOTHING justifies the deliberate war crime of firing rockets onto civilians. The rockets killed 9 already, including at least 2 Israeli Arabs... Every death, Jewish or Arab, is celebrated by terrorists.

7. “Those rockets are nothing but fireworks.”
They are absolutely deadly, and have already killed many civilians, and destroyed many homes, buildings, schools, synagogues, and playgrounds. One even managed to break through a bomb shelter, and kill a 6 year old child hiding inside.

8. “Israel’s response is disproportionate.”
A country’s very first obligation is to the safety of its citizens. If the country’s civilians are under direct attack, there is only one proportionate response, and that is to ensure that the civilians are safe again.

9. “But there are way more deaths on the other side.”
Israel’s responsibility is to make sure there are zero deaths on its side. Israel invests heavily into defensive technology like Iron Dome to protect its civilians. Hamas wantonly uses its civilians as human shields, stockpiling weapons in schools, hospitals, and other densely populated urban targets.

10. “Israel is strong and Gaza is poor. It’s not fair.”
Hamas chose to invest BILLIONS into terror infrastructure instead of the welfare of its people. There’s nothing fair about war. But there doesn’t need to be one! Israel would not attack Gaza, if Gaza never attacked Israel’s citizens. Weaker does not make one right. Evil is evil. For example, North Korea might be weaker than Japan, but it is not the hero if it launches rockets at them.

11. “Israel is killing civilians in Gaza.”
Israel has a huge challenge, because Hamas and Islamic Jihad hide their bases and equipment inside civilian buildings, including schools and hospitals. Despite this, Israel goes to extreme efforts to avoid civilian casualties. Israel is extremely precise in its targets, and always gives civilians advance warning, by first distributing flyers or calling people in the vicinity to warn them hours ahead, and then giving an additional five-minute warning with a safe “tap” on the roof. This is why there are so many videos of Gaza buildings falling - everyone around was warned and knew they would fall.
On the other hand, 1 in 4 of the rockets Hamas and Islamic Jihad shoot into Israel fall short, and land in Gaza on its own people. These fall on civilians with no warning siren, and have killed many innocent women and children.
Israel only targets Hamas militants and commanders who are actively trying to kill Israeli civilians.

12. “Gaza doesn’t have bomb shelters.”
If they didn’t shoot rockets at Israel, they wouldn’t need. By the way, those rockets cost $45,000 each. Hamas is spending over $31 million dollars a day attacking Israeli citizens, instead of protecting their own.

13. “Look at these horrible pictures of dead children in Gaza.”
Do a reverse google search, more often than not, those pictures are actually from Syria.

14. “Zionism is evil. Not all Jews are Zionists.”
Judaism is focused on a longing for Zion - Jerusalem, and Israel. Jews are from Zion/Jerusalem. For over 2,500 years Jews have been praying three times a day, and at every meal, for the return of all Jews to Zion. You cannot separate the Holy Land of Israel and Jerusalem from Judaism. Modern day political Zionism asserts the right of Jews for self-determination, like all other people have.

15. “Israelis are European colonizers.”
Jews are indigenous to Israel. Some Jews lived in Europe because colonizing forces exiled them from Israel. Currently, 52% of Israel's Jews are actually from Moslem countries from which they were expelled in the past 80 years, from Morocco to Iran. In addition, not all Israelis are Jewish. 23% are Muslim, Druze, Christian, or others, and many choose to serve in the Israeli military too."
17,16/10/2023 09:29:33,All part of the grand strategy. They are willing to expend as many lives as possible of their own children to win their political battles. They know that their allies in the west don't care about Jewish children. It really is a very clever strategy. And it keeps working.
17,16/10/2023 09:29:33,"Many Palestinians think that kidnapping Israeli children and massacring innocent Israeli civilians is justified because their hatred of Israel has overtaken any kind of rational thinking. They hate Israelis so much that they will justify anything, even keeping innocent children hostage in Gaza. 

The Palestinians are driven not by grievances over land but rather by genocidal hatred of Jews. That’s why they haven’t turned against Hamas, whose charter says they want to kill Jews and reject any Jewish state, and why there aren’t Palestinians protesting around the world against Hamas’ massacres of Jews. 

Blind hatred has made Palestinians turn a blind eye to even the worst atrocities, since they are perceived as acts of “decolonization” and “resistance”, and the ideology of many Palestinians is similar to the ideology of ISIS supporters, in terms of how willing they are to accept deliberate attacks on civilians."

17,16/10/2023 09:29:33,"Perhaps Palestinians want a peaceful resolution, maybe, but they're not willing to own to their historical mistake of getting addicted to terrorism many decades ago.

Israel proved time and again that it was willing to pursue peace with its neighbors, and it even gave up significant amount of land - the Sinai peninsula handed back to Egypt in 1979 is bigger than all of Israel. Even with the Palestinians, Israel dismantled its illegal settlements in the Gaza Strip and pulled out.

Palestinians are not willing to put down their weapons and stop their attempts to murder Jews. Their western supporters think a peace agreement is just something that can happen instantly if Israel would just agree to it.

The sad reality is that it'll take many many years of non-violence by the Palestinians before Israel will take any further chance on the peace process, in fear of their security. And like an addict that keeps going back, I don't think the Palestinians have the internal political strength, the will, and culture to stop."

18,16/11/2023 08:29:37,"I live in Israel and support Israel in its struggle to eliminate terror threats.

BUT

Part of the problem on the Israeli side is that it has refused to decide its borders. It should clearly decide which land it wants (and give full rights and citizenship to the people living there), and which land it is simply occupying until conditions form that would allow for a separate state that won't threaten Israel's security. There's no claiming land that you don't want to give citizenship to the people who live on the land. (And for the latter, Israel should not be building new settlements or expanding existing ones)

So to some extent, Israel needs to make decisions and act accordingly, not try to play both sides."
18,16/11/2023 08:29:37,"So if Israel deserves the land because they won the war, it follows that Hamas ""deserves"" the land if they ever succeed in conquering Israel.

18,16/11/2023 08:29:37,"**The land should belong to those who were there first.**

Israel existed in that place, populated by Jews, between 3200 and 3800 years ago, depending on which historians you believe.

**The land should belong to those who owned it.**

Jews have maintained a constant presence in Israel since they came there from Egypt, some time between 1900 and 1200 BC, despite being conquered and expelled multiple times.  In 637AD, Jerusalem was a Christian city and had been for hundreds of years.  Muslims conquered it in 638AD, but the Jews remained.  The area changed hands a few times during the crusades, but ended up in the hands of Saladin.  Fearing the return of the crusaders, the Muslims destroyed coastal cities and filled in harbors to prevent sea landings.  After the death of Saladin and the fall of the Ayyubid dynasty, the Mamluk dynasty continued this policy, leading to the area becoming desolate and largely uninhabited by the late 15th century... but still the Jews remained.  After Spain kicked out the Muslims who had held the country for several hundred years, they banned both Jews and Muslims from the country.  This led many Spanish Jews to go to Israel (which under the Mamluks was part of Syria).  There are several contemporary accounts from travelers of the time regarding how unpopulated and how much of a wasteland the area was.  There were small populations in a few cities, but little else.

Interestingly, the first significant migration of European Jews back to the area after the migration from Spain came under Sultan Selim II, in 1558, who encouraged Jews to move to the area.

Napoleon conquered the area in 1799 and planned a Jewish state there, but the idea was shelved after his defeat at Acre.

There were a couple more attempts to create Jewish communities over the next century, mostly sidelined by Druze revolts.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, European Jews began moving back to the area in numbers due to persecution in Europe.  The Jewish National Fund was established during this same period, to purchase land in Israel.  The fund purchased land from absentee Ottoman landlords, who thought they were putting one over on the Jews by selling them deserts and swamps.  The Jews promptly irrigated the deserts, drained the swamps, and built an economy.  To this day, the Jewish National Fund is the single largest landholder in Israel.

**The land should belong to those who set up a country there.**

After the Central Powers lost WWI and the Ottoman Empire was broken up, the League of Nations gave the UK the Mandate of Palestine with the purpose of setting up a Jewish homeland.  When the League of Nations was replaced by the UN, the UN voted to create a Jewish Homeland in the space, and a Palestinian homeland, via the partition plan.  The Jews accepted the agreement, all Arab nations voted against it, and the Arabs immediately began a civil war, so the plan was never implemented.  When the British Mandate ended, the Jews declared their own independent state, according to the UN's plan.  ...and all of their neighbors immediately declared war on them.

**The land should belong to those who won it by conquest.**

When all of Israel's neighbors declared war on them in 1948, the idea was to push the Jews into the sea.  It didn't work out that way.  The Arabs tried again in 1956, 1967, and 1973.  It did not go as they'd hoped."
18,16/11/2023 08:29:37,"If the Middle East countries had won the wars, they wouldn’t be talking about giving back the land or repatriating the Jews. They would have gladly killed every Jew and claimed victory. It’s a pity israel doesn’t do the same."

19,12/05/2021 09:44:25,"The Democratic Party, the dominant one in American politics, is having influential figures speak out against Israel, and when one backed Israel he was criticised heavily for it. When the inevitable happens that one of these more left-wing Democratic figures eventually gets the Presidency (which will happen eventually) it will be interesting to see the result in regards to US-Israel relations.

Already even figures like Biden have been co-opting left-wing policies to try and ""stem the tide"" of momentum growing in favour, so I would reckon he will be the same with Israel... trying to keep his distance so as to not piss off the left. The days of support for Israel being part of American identity are numbered"

I am not going into the caused and right wrong of things.
The bottom line is that the gaza images are far harsher, so people are going to side with them, regardless of them starting it."

And there are billions of Muslims vs about 15 million jews"
19,12/05/2021 09:44:25,"“Palestinian propaganda”.

I don’t know what the propaganda is. Israel did do something wrong. Hamas did something wrong. Two wrongs don’t make a right, and without sounding like a child, Israel started it by kicking Palestinians out of there home in Sheik Jarrah and using force on protesters at Al Aqsa."

In the real world you have to look at our advancing relationships with countries, investments of almost every high-tech company, exports etc. That is the real world."

19,12/05/2021 09:44:25,"Israel is a single country, the lone Jewish state in the entire world representing a people who comprise less than a fraction of a percent of the world population. There are only so many people to defend Israel as Israelis and Jews, and even if every single one of them did so, they would be outnumbered by the sheer amount of people whose entire identity is to erase Israel by any means necessary. Israel is constantly losing the PR war whether or not they behave in a way that is untoward. The western media has no interest in fairly portraying the conflict and that isn't going to change because of social media"
