It was essential the soldiers knew that ""Terrorist"" isn't just an arbitrary term used and abused by our leadership.

So for us, the simple definition was whether someone targeted civilians as a standard operating procedure.

22,2.0,"First we have to establish what the goal of the operation was: to degrade the capability of the terror organisations in Jenin and ensure more freedom of operation for the IDF there.

Jenin has really become a hotbed for militancy, especially over the last year and a half, with there being a build up of capability in the city and also IED‚Äôs and whatnot being a threat which made it hard for the IDF to operate in the area. This operation focused on degrading the capabilities of the groups, which we saw with the destruction of command centres, an explosives laboratory, the seizure of explosive devices and other weapons. We also saw the IDF trying to clear IED‚Äôs from the area, which is what we saw them doing to the streets.

You have characterised the operation as some all-encompassing, indiscriminate attack, but every Palestinian killed was claimed as a terrorist by their respective groups. The operations do impact civilians, and that‚Äôs a terrible thing, but it‚Äôs the terror groups who choose to hide themselves amongst the civilian population, the onus for what happens next is on them",2023-07-08 14:02:44
23,2.0,"Lots of comments already and you‚Äôre doing a great job responding to them all.  I‚Äôll just add my two cents, both from the perspective of an Israel supporter and, probably more importantly, from (non-IDF) military experience.

I think ‚Äútargeted‚Äù in this context means something very different than it would in ordinary English.  Urban warfare in a densely populated place like Jenin is so difficult and dangerous that it is hard to accurately describe in a way that will do it justice.  Any military‚Äôs priority is to accomplish the mission with minimum casualties ‚Äî meaning casualties on your side, not the other side.  Casualties on the other side should be minimized to the extent possible, but not at the risk of endangering our own side.  

So the ordinary military calculus for an operation like Jenin generally leads to one conclusion: aerial bombardment to eliminate targets at maximum distance and with the least risk to your own units.  In other words, flatten the place.  Israel could easily do so, and mission accomplished.

But Israel doesn‚Äôt want to do that for lots of political and genuinely held humanitarian reasons.  As a result, Israel fights the Palestinian militant organizations with both hands and one foot tied behind its back.  (To be clear, the US would not do this if it were in Israel‚Äôs position.)  Instead of flattening Jenin, the IDF went in with ground units supported by armor and some air support to take out specific targets.  This is an unbelievably risky thing to do, they didn‚Äôt have to do it, but it seems to have gone relatively well all things considered.  That there appear to have been only two non-combatant fatalities during the whole operation is nothing short of miraculous, in my opinion.

So anyways, ‚Äútargeted‚Äù is a relative term.  Was it ‚Äútargeted‚Äù in terms of impacting only the people actually responsible for terror attacks in Israel?  Definitely not.  Jenin is trashed and more than 100 people were injured.  But was it ‚Äútargeted‚Äù in terms of killing only the people Israel actually meant to kill?  Overwhelmingly yes, at least in comparison to any of the other strategic options Israel might have chosen.",2023-07-08 14:02:44
24,2.0,"We can't deny that the daily lives of Jenin's residents got affected by the operation. However, when more than 50 attacks launched from Jenin, plus the murder of Israeli civilians which also affected Israel and daily lives of its citizens - no one questioned the actions. No mainstream international media coverage. No criticism by the west (Please correct me if I am wrong). How can the attack not intrusive to Israelis? 

I hope the people who condemned the operation could also give suggestions on ways to do it differently with similar effectiveness. We are talking about an armed group who were pointing guns at them, and hiding weapons, explosives in public places such mosque to be used to kill Israeli civilians. The people who condemn the Israelis actions, their countries would do 10x worser if they face similar attack.

Lives lost are tragic, no matter it's Israeli or Palestinian. We can't talk about being fair when we ignore the attack and killing of Israeli civilians perpetrated by the armed group from Jenin.",2023-07-08 14:02:44
25,2.0,"Harboring terrorists, willfully or not, has consequences. In this case those consequences were property and infrastructure damage, and obviously dead terrorists.

Jenin refugee camp by no means meets the definition of neither a camp or refugees. It's a city with permanent concrete structures and infrastructure, and the people there are 3rd generation of those who are questionable refugees. Refugee status doesn't pass over generations.

A large part of the population in Jenin makes a living by working in israel with a work permit granted to them.

I dont like seeing anyone suffer, especially children, and I'm sure the vast majority of Israelis have the same sentiment. With that said, the Israeli government has a responsibility to protect its citizens. I do not see this operation as an intentional ""punishment"" to everyone in Jenin and the west bank. I'm glad there were no innocent civilian casualties. 

I think the citizens of the west bank need to start their own revolution and demand leadership that would actually look out for their best interest. Their best interest is NOT fighting forever, costing not only lives but keeping the Palestinians forever in a state of suffering in all aspects. This revolution will have casualties as all revolutions. I personally don't know of any country that was ever established in history without going through a revolution, war or another painful and violent event. A state is never handed to you, you need to fight for it, the only problem here is the Palestinians believe they need to fight israel when in fact they need to fight their own leadership. 

There is a clear correlation between IDF operations in the west bank and attacks spawned from there. For several years the west bank has been quiet, many areas there have thrived and prospered.

27,2.0,"I don't have a specific opinion but most of your questions are fairly general. There are militant organizations operating in the camp with widespread popular support.  This Lions' Den organization being the new wild card.   These organizations have launched rockets and conducted attacks outside the camp.  So they do constitute an ongoing threat to life and limb of other persons.  That's the sort of thing a state is obligated to resolve. The PA has indicated it has lost control of Jenin Refugee Camp and is not able to maintain order there.

This creates 3 possible status for the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp that could apply depending on one's point of view: 

1.  They are subjects of Israel.  As such they have an obligation to compliance and in exchange get protections granted by Israel. 
2.  They are citizens of Palestine.  As such they have an obligation to active assist the PA in maintaining the rule of law.  As such they get a say in how to resolve the situation. 
3.  They reside in guerilla held territory as willing subjects if not citizens of whatever government of the Jenin Refugee Camp can plausibly claim the Lion's Den. 

(see https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/12o5wod/citizens_vs_subject_obligations/)

(3) makes them responsible for the Lion's Den's actions. Their failure to meet their obligations under (2) is why the IDF was involved at all.  Their failure to meet their obligations under (1) is why Israel is allowed to treat the territory as hostile. 

So we have a situation of one military battling another military with the purpose of subduing it and conquering it.  That's pretty unpleasant to be on the losing side of.  As far as I can tell from the descriptions of the attack the Israelis appeared to mostly be doing things consistent with their military objectives.  They were tearing up roads the Lion's Den had mined, they shot infantry under Lion's Den command... That doesn't sound like anything other than what Israel is supposed to do in this situation. Before anyone comments I'll agree in advance that there probably were soldiers who made poor choices.  But my point is that the overall structure, that is what was decided at a state level, is consistent with Israel's obligations given the situation the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp presented them with.   

If the residents of Jenin Refugee Camp don't want to face the IDF then they need to come into compliance with Israeli law.   For police to operate successfully they need some level of community support.  The alternative to police is not self rule, it is facing a military.  The definition of a government is the entity that has established a monopoly on final force.  Israel has that monopoly. The Lion's Den challenged that monopoly unsuccessfully.

It's worth noting that ""children"" (meaning, people below the age of 18) being killed does not mean that civilians were killed, Not every person below the age of 18 is a civilian.

Some of the confirmed militants were 16 and 17; those are the ""dead children"" you hear about.

Palestine uses child soldiers. I wish they didn't have to die, but when an armed person poses a threat, they should be killed regardless of their age.

For example here in the US, where there are many school shootings, the shooters are often children themselves, and they often need to be killed by the police. It is correct for the police to do this.

The quickest way to assure the largest possible number of Arabs die, is to educate your Arab soldiers to launch ranged weapons from public areas. So that‚Äôs what they instruct them to do.
